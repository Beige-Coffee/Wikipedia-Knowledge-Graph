[[Tomb]] is a general term for the repository, while [[grave goods]] are objects—other than the primary human remains—which have been placed inside.<ref>Hammond, 58–9 characterizes [[Dismemberment|disarticulated]] human skeletal remains packed in body bags and incorporated into [[Formative stage|Pre-Classic]] [[Mesoamerica]]n [[mass burial]]s (along with a set of primary remains) at Cuello, [[Belize]] as \"human grave goods\".</ref> Such objects may include the personal possessions of the deceased, objects specially created for the burial, or miniature versions of things believed to be needed in an [[afterlife]].  Knowledge of many non-literate cultures is drawn largely from these sources.\\n\\nFunerary art can serve many cultural functions.  It can play a role in burial rites, serve as an article for use by the dead in the afterlife, and celebrate the life and accomplishments of the dead, whether as part of kinship-centered practices of [[ancestor veneration]] or as a publicly directed [[Dynasty|dynastic]] display.  It can also function as a reminder of the mortality of humankind, as an expression of cultural values and roles, and help to propitiate the spirits of the dead, maintaining their benevolence and preventing their unwelcome intrusion into the affairs of the living.  \\n\\nThe deposit of objects with an apparent aesthetic intention may go back to the [[Neanderthal]]s over 50,000 years ago,<ref>Depending on the interpretation of sites like the [[Shanidar Cave]] in Iraq. Bogucki, 64–66 summarizes the debate.  Gargett takes a hostile view but accepts (p. 29 etc.) that many or most scholars do not. See also Pettitt.</ref> and is found in almost all subsequent cultures—the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] culture, which has little, is a notable exception.<ref>\"[Hindu] disposal of their dead by cremation and a belief in reincarnation tended to obviate an inherent interest in permanent markers\". Groseclose, 23</ref> Many of the best-known artistic creations of past cultures—from the [[Egyptian pyramids]] and the [[KV62|Tutankhamun treasure]] to the [[Terracotta Army]] surrounding the tomb of the [[Qin Shi Huang|Qin Emperor]], the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]], the [[Sutton Hoo]] ship burial and the [[Taj Mahal]]—are tombs or objects found in and around them.  In most instances, specialized funeral art was produced for the powerful and wealthy, although the burials of ordinary people might include simple monuments and grave goods, usually from their possessions.\\n\\nAn important factor in the development of traditions of funerary art is the division between what was intended to be visible to visitors or the public after completion of the [[funeral]] ceremonies.<ref>See for example the chapter \"Tombs for the Living and the Dead\", Insoll 176–87</ref>  The [[Tutankhamun]] treasure, for example, though exceptionally lavish, was never intended to be seen again by humans after it was deposited, while the exterior of the Pyramids were a permanent and highly effective demonstration of the power of their creators.  A similar division can be seen in grand East Asian tombs. In other cultures nearly all the art connected with the burial, except for limited grave goods, was intended to remain visible to the public, or at least those admitted by the custodians.  In these cultures traditions such as the sculpted  [[sarcophagus]] and [[tomb monument]]s of the Greek and Roman empires, and later the Christian world, have flourished. The [[mausoleum]] intended for visiting was the grandest type of tomb in the classical world, and later common in [[Islam]]ic culture.\\n\\n==Common terms==\\nA [[tumulus]], mound, [[kurgan]], or [[long barrow]] covered important [[burial]]s in many cultures, and the body may be placed in a sarcophagus, usually of stone, or a [[coffin]], usually of wood.  A mausoleum is a building erected mainly as a tomb, taking its name from the Mausoleum of Mausolus at [[Halicarnassus]].  [[Stele]] is a term for erect stones that are often what are now called [[gravestone]]s.  [[Ship burial]]s are mostly found in coastal Europe, while [[chariot burial]]s are found widely across [[Eurasia]]. [[Catacombs]], of which the most famous examples are those in [[Catacombs of Rome|Rome]] and [[Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa|Alexandria]], are underground cemeteries connected by tunnelled passages.  A large group of burials with traces remaining above ground can be called a [[necropolis]]; if there are no such visible structures, it is a [[grave field]].  A [[cenotaph]] is a memorial without a burial.<ref>See any well-regarded survey of the [[history of art]] or of [[history of architecture|architecture]], such as \\'\\'[[Gardner\\'s Art Through the Ages]]\\'\\' or the most recent edition of Sir [[Banister Fletcher]]\\'s \\'\\'A History of Architecture.\\'\\'</ref>\\n\\nRelated genres of commemorative art for the dead take many forms, such as the \\'\\'[[moai]]\\'\\' figures of [[Easter Island]], apparently a type of sculpted [[ancestor portrait]], though hardly individualized.<ref>[http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aoa/h/hoa_hakananaia.aspx Hoa Hakananai\\'a] British Museum, accessed 26 April, 2010</ref>  These are common in cultures as diverse as Ancient Rome and China, in both of which they are kept in the houses of the descendants, rather than being buried.<ref>Toynbee, 47–48, on Ancient Rome. Stewart and Rawski\\'s book is entirely devoted to Chinese ancestor portraits. See Chapter 1 etc.</ref>  Many cultures have [[psychopomp]] figures, such as the Greek [[Hermes]] and Etruscan [[Charun]], who help conduct the spirits of the dead into the afterlife.\\n\\n== Pre-history==\\n{{Main|Megalith}}\\n[[Image:paulnabrone.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Poulnabrone dolmen]] in Ireland covered at least 22 bodies of the [[Neolithic]] period]]\\n\\nMost of humanity\\'s oldest known archaeological constructions are tombs.<ref>Although the purpose of megalithic structures is not always clear, and of the very oldest, while [[Nevali Cori]] in Turkey contains burials, [[Göbekli Tepe]] appears not to.</ref> Mostly [[megalith]]ic, the earliest instances date to within a few centuries of each other, yet show a wide diversity of form and purpose. Tombs in the [[Iberian peninsula]] have been dated through [[thermoluminescence]] to c. 4510 BCE, and some burials at the [[Carnac stones]] in [[Brittany]] also date back to the fifth millennium BCE.<ref>Mohen, 70</ref> The commemorative value of such burial sites are indicated by the fact that, at some stage, they became elevated, and that the constructs, almost from the earliest, sought to be monumental. This effect was often achieved by encapsulating a single corpse in a basic pit, surrounded by an elaborate ditch and drain. Over-ground commemoration is thought to be tied to the concept of collective memory, and these early tombs were likely intended as a form of [[ancestor-worship]], a development available only to communities that had advanced to the stage of settled livestock and formed social roles and relationships and specialized sectors of activity.<ref>Mohen, 87</ref>\\n\\nIn [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] societies, a great variety of tombs are found, with tumulus mounds, megaliths and pottery as recurrent elements. In Eurasia, a [[dolmen]] is the exposed stone framework for a [[chamber tomb]] originally covered by earth to make a mound which no longer exists.  Stones may be carved with geometric patterns ([[petroglyph]]s), for example [[cup and ring mark]]s.  Group tombs were made, the social context of which is hard to decipher. [[Urn]] burials, where bones are buried in a pottery container, either in a more elaborate tomb, or by themselves, are widespread, by no means restricted to the [[Urnfield culture]] which is named after them, or even to Eurasia.  [[Menhir]]s, or \"[[standing stone]]s\", seem often to mark graves or serve as memorials,<ref>Kipfer, \"Menhir\", 348</ref> while the later [[runestone]]s and [[image stone]]s often are [[cenotaph]]s, or memorials apart from the grave itself; these continue into the Christian period. The [[Senegambian stone circles]] are a later African form of tomb markers.<ref>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1226 Stone Circles of Senegambia – UNESCO World Heritage Centre], accessed April 28, 2010</ref>\\n\\n== Ancient Egypt and Nubia==\\n{{main|Art of ancient Egypt}}\\n[[Image:Egypte louvre 239 masque.jpg|thumb|Egyptian ceramic coffin mask|alt=An oversized, shallow mask depicting a large face. The face is roughly oval-shaped, but the top of the mask is a horizontal line just above the eyebrows, leaving the entire mask roughly triangular. The entire face is flattened, but the bulbous nose protrudes away from the face. The eyes are large and almond shaped, and both the eyes and braided eyebrows are disproportionally large in comparison with the mouth, which has full lips. The front of the face is clean-shaven, but below the chin, there is a long, narrow, pointed, braided false beard that was characteristic of ancient Egyptian royalty.]]\\n\\nEgyptian funerary art was inseparably connected to the [[Ancient Egyptian religion|religious belief]] that life continued after death – even more, it expressed a belief that \"death is a mere phase of life\".<ref>Groenewegen-Frankfort, 80</ref> Aesthetic objects and images connected with this belief were partially intended to preserve material goods, wealth and status for the journey between this life and the next,<ref>Stone, 37</ref> and to \"commemorate the life of the tomb owner ... depict performance of the burial rites, and in general present an environment that would be conducive to the tomb owner\\'s rebirth.\"<ref>Kampen&nbsp;et&nbsp;al, 31</ref> In this context, Egyptian [[mummy|mummies]] encased in one or more layers of decorated coffin, are famous; [[canopic jar]]s preserved the internal organs. A special category of [[Ancient Egyptian funerary texts]] clarify the purposes of the burial customs.  The early [[mastaba]] type of tomb had a sealed underground burial chamber but an offering-chamber on the ground level for visits by the living, a pattern repeated in later types of tomb. An effigy of the deceased might be walled up in a \\'\\'[[serdab]]\\'\\' connected to the offering chamber by vents that allowed the smell of [[incense]] to reach the effigy.<ref>Maspero, 111—127, with \\'\\'serdabs\\'\\' 124—125</ref>   The walls of important tomb-chambers and offering chambers were heavily decorated with [[relief]]s in stone or sometimes wood, or paintings, depicting religious scenes, portraits of the deceased, and at some periods vivid images of everyday life, depicting the afterlife. The chamber decoration usually centred on a \"false door\", through which only the soul of the deceased could pass, to received the offerings left by the living.<ref>Robins, 51–55, 66–71, 218–219, and see index for other periods. Tomb styles changed considerably over the course of Egyptian history.</ref> \\n\\n[[Representation (arts)|Representational art]], such as individual portraiture of the deceased, is found extremely early on and continues into the Roman period in the [[Encaustic painting|encaustic]] [[Faiyum mummy portraits|Faiyum funerary portraits]] applied to coffins. However, it is still hotly debated whether there was realistic [[portraiture in Ancient Egypt]].<ref>Spanel, 23</ref>  The purpose of the life-sized [[reserve head]]s found in burial shafts or tombs of nobles of the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|Fourth dynasty]] is not well understood; they may have been a discreet method of eliding an edict by [[Khufu]] forbidding nobles from creating statues of themselves, or may have protected the deceased\\'s spirit from harm or magically eliminated any evil in it, or perhaps functioned as alternate containers for the spirit if the body should be harmed in any way.<ref>Atiya & El Shawahy, 73</ref> \\n \\nArchitectural works such as the massive [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] and two smaller ones built during the [[Old Kingdom]] in the [[Giza Necropolis]] and (much later, from about 1500&nbsp;BCE) the tombs in the [[Valley of the Kings]] were built for royalty and the elite. The [[Theban Necropolis]] was later an important site for [[mortuary temple]]s and mastaba tombs.  The [[Kushite]] kings who conquered Egypt and ruled as pharaohs during the [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-fifth dynasty]] were greatly influenced by Egyptian funerary customs, employing mummification, canopic jars and \\'\\'[[ushabti]]\\'\\' funerary figurines. They also built the [[Nubian pyramids]], which in both size and design more closely resemble the smaller [[Seventeenth dynasty of Egypt|Seventeenth dynasty]] pyramids at Thebes than those of the Old Kingdom near Memphis.<ref>Boardman, Edwards \\'\\'et al\\'\\', 688–9</ref>\\n\\nLower-class citizens used common forms of funerary art—including \\'\\'[[shabti]]\\'\\' figurines (to perform any labor that might be required of the dead person in the afterlife), [[Dung beetle#Scarab in Ancient Egypt|models of the scarab beetle]] and books of the dead—which they believed would protect them in the afterlife.<ref>James, 122</ref> During the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], miniature wooden or clay models depicting scenes from everyday life became popular additions to tombs. In an attempt to duplicate the activities of the living in the afterlife, these models show laborers, houses, boats and even military formations which are scale representations of the ideal ancient Egyptian afterlife.<ref>Robins, 74</ref>\\n\\n==Ancient Greece==\\n[[Image:NAMA Hermès & Myrrhinè.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Relief from a carved funerary \\'\\'[[lekythos]]\\'\\' at the [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]]: [[Hermes]] conducts the deceased, \\'\\'Myrrhine\\'\\', to [[Hades]], c. 430–420 BCE|alt=A carving of a noble robed man and woman apparently leading a demure, robed woman.

He holds the hand of the woman.]]\\n\\nThe ancient Greeks did not generally leave elaborate grave goods, except for a [[Charon\\'s obol|coin to pay Charon]], the [[Charon (mythology)|ferryman to Hades]], and pottery; however the \\'\\'epitaphios\\'\\' or [[Funeral oration (ancient Greece)|funeral oration]]&nbsp;from which the word [[epitaph]] comes&nbsp;was regarded as of great importance, and [[animal sacrifice]]s were made.   Those who could afford them erected stone monuments, which was one of the functions of \\'\\'[[kouros]]\\'\\' statues in the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic period]] before about 500&nbsp;BCE.  These were not intended as portraits, but during the [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic period]], realistic portraiture of the deceased was introduced and family groups were often depicted in [[bas-relief]] on monuments, usually surrounded by an architectural frame.<ref>Boardman, 212, 15</ref>  The walls of tomb chambers were often painted in [[fresco]], although few examples have survived in as good condition as the [[Tomb of the Diver]] from southern Italy or the tombs at [[Vergina]] in Macedon.  Almost the only surviving painted portraits in the classical Greek tradition are found in Egypt rather than Greece. The [[Fayum mummy portraits]], from the very end of the classical period, were portrait faces, in a [[Greco-Roman world|Graeco-Roman]] style, attached to mummies.<ref>Oakes & Gahlin, 236</ref>\\n\\nEarly Greek burials were frequently marked above ground by a large piece of [[Pottery of ancient Greece|pottery]], and remains were also buried in urns.  Pottery continued to be used extensively inside tombs and graves throughout the classical period.<ref>Boardman, 26 and passim</ref>   The \\'\\'[[Larnax (Archaeology)|larnax]]\\'\\' is a small coffin or ash-chest, usually of decorated [[terracotta]]. The two-handled \\'\\'[[loutrophoros]]\\'\\' was primarily associated with weddings, as it was used to carry water for the [[nuptial]] bath. However, it was also placed in the tombs of the unmarried, \"presumably to make up in some way for what they had missed in life.\"<ref>Richter, 57</ref> The one-handled \\'\\'[[lekythos]]\\'\\' had many household uses, but outside the household, its principal use was the decoration of tombs.<ref>Henderson, 135</ref> Scenes of a [[descent to the underworld]] of [[Hades]] were often painted on these, with the dead depicted beside [[Hermes]], Charon or both—though usually only with Charon.<ref>Wright, 391</ref> Small pottery figurines are often found, though it is hard to decide if these were made especially for placement in tombs; in the case of the [[Hellenistic]] [[Tanagra figurines]], this seems probably not the case.<ref>Boardman, 212–13</ref> But silverware is more often found around the fringes of the Greek world, as in the royal [[Macedon]]ian tombs of [[Vergina]], or in the neighbouring cultures such as those of [[Thrace]] or the [[Scythians]].<ref>Boardman, 149–50</ref>\\n\\nThe extension of the Greek world after the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] brought peoples with different tomb-making traditions into the [[Hellenistic]] sphere, resulting in new formats for art in Greek styles.<ref>Boardman, 151–154, and throughout the section on the period</ref>  A generation before Alexander, Mausolus was a Hellenized [[satrap]] or semi-independent ruler under the [[Persian Empire]], whose enormous tomb (begun 353 BCE) was wholly exceptional in the Greek world – together with the Pyramids it was the only tomb to be be included in the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]].  The exact form of the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]], which gave the name to the form, is now unclear, and there are several alternative reconstructions that seek to reconcile the archaeological evidence with descriptions in literature.<ref>Boardman, 126–127. Apart from those at the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]] article, there are several from Lethaby\\'s 1908 work [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Turkey/_Periods/Greek/_Texts/LETGKB/Mausoleum*.html here], and one illustrated in Boardman.</ref>  It had the size and some elements of the design of the [[Greek temple]], but was much more vertical, with a square base and a pyramidal roof.  There were quantities of large sculpture.<ref>Boardman, 126–127</ref>  Other local rulers adapted the high-relief temple [[frieze]] for very large sarcophagi, starting a tradition which was to exert a great influence on Western art up to 18th century [[Neo-Classicism]].  The late 4th century [[Alexander Sarcophagus]] was in fact made for another Hellenized Eastern ruler, one of a number of important sarcophagi found at [[Sidon]] in the modern [[Lebanon]].  The two long sides show Alexander\\'s great victory at the [[Battle of Issus]] and a lion hunt; such violent scenes were common on ostentatious classical sarcophagi from this period onwards, with a particular revival in Roman art of the 2nd century.

Often a couple are shown, signifying a longing for reunion in the afterlife rather than a double burial.<ref>Toynbee, Chapter IV; Hall, 53</ref> \\n\\nIn later periods, life-size sculptures of the deceased reclining as though at a meal or social gathering are found, a common Etruscan style.  Family tombs for the grandest late Roman families, like the [[Tomb of the Scipios]], were large mausoleums with facilities for visits by the living, including kitchens and bedrooms.  The [[Castel Sant\\'Angelo]], built for [[Hadrian]], was later converted into a fortress.  Compared to the Etruscans, though, there was less emphasis on provision of a lifestyle for the deceased, although paintings of useful objects or pleasant activities, like hunting, are seen.<ref>Toynbee, 38</ref>  Ancestor portraits, usually in the form of wax masks, were kept in the home, apparently often in little cupboards,<ref>Toynbee, 31&nbsp;(illustration)</ref> although grand patrician families kept theirs on display in the \\'\\'[[Domus|atrium]]\\'\\'.  They were worn in the funeral processions of members of the family by persons wearing appropriate costume for the figure represented, as described by [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Polybius]].  Pliny also describes the custom of having a bust-portrait of an ancestor painted on a round bronze shield (\\'\\'[[clipeus]]\\'\\'), and having it hung in a temple or other public place.  No examples of either type have survived.<ref>Hall, 15, 35, 78</ref> \\n\\nBy the late [[Roman Republic|Republic]] there was considerable competition among wealthy Romans for the best locations for tombs, which lined all the approach roads to the city up to the walls, and a variety of exotic and unusual designs sought to catch the attention of the passer-by and so perpetuate the memory of the deceased and increase the prestige of their family.  Examples include the [[Tomb of Eurysaces the Baker]], a [[freedman]], the [[Pyramid of Cestius]], and the Mausoleum of [[Caecilia Metella (daughter of Metellus Creticus)|Caecilia Metella]], all built within a few decades of the start of the [[Common Era]].<ref>Petersen, 95—105; see also Boardman, 240—241 on Eurysaces\\' tomb.</ref>    \\n\\nIn Italy, sarcophagi were mostly intended to be set against the wall of the tomb, and only decorated on three sides, in contrast to the free-standing styles of Greece and the Eastern Empire. The relief scenes of Hellenistic art became even more densely crowded in later Roman sarcophagi, as for example in the 2nd century [[Portonaccio sarcophagus]], and various styles and forms emerged, such as the columnar type with an \"architectural background of columns and niches for its figures\".<ref>Boardman, 339</ref>  A well-known Early Christian example is the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]], used for an important new convert who died in 359. Many sarcophagi from leading centres were exported around the Empire.<ref>Boardman, 339–344; Hall, 78–80</ref>  The Romans had already developed the expression of religious and philosophical ideas in narrative scenes from [[Greek mythology]], treated [[allegorically]];<ref>Hall, 54–61</ref> they later transferred this habit to Christian ideas, using Biblical scenes.<ref>Hall, 77–82</ref>\\n\\n==China==\\n[[File:SAM Art Ladder military guardian.jpg|thumb|\"Military Guardian\", Chinese funerary statue. Seattle Art Museum, Seattle, Washington.]]\\nFunerary art varied greatly across Chinese history. Tombs of early rulers rival the ancient Egyptians for complexity and value of grave goods, and have been similarly pillaged over the centuries by [[tomb robber]]s.  For a long time, literary references to [[jade burial suit]]s were regarded by scholars as fanciful myths, but a number of examples were excavated in the 20th century, and it is now believed that they were relatively common among early rulers.  Knowledge of pre-dynastic Chinese culture has been expanded by spectacular discoveries at [[Sanxingdui]] and other sites.  Very large tumuli could be erected, and later, mausoleums.  Several special large shapes of [[Shang dynasty]] bronze ritual vessels may have been made for burial only; the [[Tomb of Fu Hao]] (c BCE 1200) is one of the few undisturbed royal tombs of the period to have been excavated—most funerary art has appeared on the art market without archaeological context.<ref>See for example  Merriman, 297</ref> \\n\\nThe discovery in 1974 of the [[Terracotta army]] located the tomb of the [[First Qin Emperor]] (died 210 BCE), but the main tumulus, of which literary descriptions survive,  has not been excavated.  Remains surviving above ground from several imperial tombs of the [[Han dynasty]] show traditions maintained until the end of imperial rule.  The tomb itself is an \"underground palace\" beneath a sealed tumulus surrounded by a wall, with several buildings set at some distance away down avenues for the observation of rites of veneration, and the accomodation of both permanent staff and those visiting to perform rites, as well as gateways, towers and other buildings.  This complex is approached by a \"spirit road\", sometimes several kilometres long, lined by statues of guardian figures, based on both humans and animals, and [[Bixi (tortoise)|\\'\\'bixi\\'\\']] or stelae mounted on tortoises. In Han tombs the guardian figures are mainly of \"lions\" and \"[[chimera]]s\"; in later periods they are much more varied.<ref>Sickman & Soper, 57-66; see also [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4gNk5HzIIKgC&pg=PA31&dq=Han+cemetery+marker+que&lr=&ei=LeLfS_P-NYvONd_D-M8K&cd=4#v=onepage&q&f=false the diagram here]</ref>  A looted tomb with fine paintings is the [[Empress Dowager Wenming tomb]] of the 5th century CE, and the many tombs of the 7th century [[Tang dynasty]] [[Qianling Mausoleum]] group are an early example of a generally well-preserved ensemble.<ref>Sickman & Soper, 155</ref>  The [[complex of Goguryeo Tombs]], from a kingdom of the 5th to 7th centuries which included modern [[Korea]], are especially rich in paintings.  Only one of the [[Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties]] has been excavated, in 1956, with such [[Ming Dynasty Tombs|disastrous results]] for the conservation of the thousands of objects found, that the current policy is to leave them undisturbed.<ref>Evasdottir, 158—160</ref>   \\n\\nThe [[Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum]] in Hong Kong displays a far humbler middle-class Han dynasty tomb, and the mid-2nd century Wu Family tombs of [[Jiaxiang County]], [[Shandong]] are the most important group of commoner tombs for funerary stones.  The walls of both the offering and burial chambers of tombs of commoners from the Han period may be decorated with stone slabs carved or engraved in very low relief with crowded and varied scenes, which are now the main indication of the style of the lost palace frescos of the period.  A cheaper option was to use large clay tiles which were carved or impressed before firing.<ref>Sickman & Soper, 77-84</ref>  After the introduction of Buddhism, carved \"funerary couches\" featured similar scenes, now mostly religious.<ref>Sickman & Soper, 120-121</ref> During the Han Dynasty, [[Science_and_technology_of_the_Han_Dynasty#Ceramic_model_buildings|miniature ceramic models]] of buildings were often made to accompany the deceased in the graves; to them is owed much of what is known of ancient Chinese architecture. Later, during the [[Six Dynasties]], sculptural miniatures depicting buildings, monuments, people and animals adorned the tops of the \\'\\'[[hunping]]\\'\\' funerary vessels.<ref name=dien>Dien, 214–215</ref>  The outsides of tombs often featured monumental brick or stone-carved pillar-gates (que 闕); an example from 121 CE appears to be the earliest surviving Chinese architectural structure standing above ground.<ref>Sickman & Soper, 376 (illustrated)</ref> \\n\\nEarly burial customs show a strong belief in an afterlife and a spirit path to it that needed facilitating.

There is usually one or more T-shaped shrine buildings some distance in front of the tomb, which is set in extensive grounds, usually with a hill behind them, and facing a view towards water and distant hills.  They are still a focus for [[ancestor worship]] rituals.

Instead, most Mesoamerican funerary art takes the form of grave goods and, in [[Oaxaca]], funerary urns.

Of particular note are the various ceramic tableaux including village scenes, for example, players engaged in a [[Mesoamerican ballgame]].

Burial was, for as long as there was room, usually in a graveyard adjacent to the church, with a gravestone or horizontal slab, or for the wealthy or important clergy, inside it. Wall tombs in churches strictly include the body itself, often in a sarcophagus, while often the body is buried in a [[crypt]] or under the church floor, with a monument on the wall. Persons of importance, especially monarchs, might be buried in a free-standing sarcophagus, perhaps surrounded by an elaborate enclosure using metalwork and sculpture; grandest of all were the [[shrine]]s of saints, which became the destinations of [[pilgrimage]]s. The monument to [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]] in the [[Hofkirche, Innsbruck]] took decades to complete,<ref>Board of Trustees for The Hofkirche in Innsbruck.</ref> while the [[Arca di San Domenico|tomb of Saint Dominic]] in [[Bologna]] took several centuries to reach its final form.<ref>Welch, 26</ref>\\n\\nIf only because its strong prejudice against free-standing and life-size sculpture, [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] could not have developed the tomb monument in the same way as the Western Church, and the burials of rich or important individuals continued the classical tradition of sarcophagi carved in relief, with the richness of the carving tending to diminish over the centuries, until just simple religious symbols were left.  [[Constantine I]] and most later [[Byzantine Emperor]]s up to 1028 were buried in the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] in Constantinople, which was destroyed after the [[fall of Constantinople]] of 1453.  Some massive but mostly plain [[porphyry]] sarcophagi from the church are now placed outside the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]].<ref>Downey.</ref>\\n\\nThe [[Tomb of Antipope John XXIII]] in [[Florence]] is a grand [[Early Renaissance]] wall tomb by [[Donatello]] and [[Michelozzo]]; although classical in style, it reflects the somewhat inharmonious stacking up of different elements typical of major Gothic tombs.  It has a life-size effigy lying on the sarcophagus, which was common from the Romanesque period through to the [[Baroque]] and beyond.<ref>Levey 1967, 57–59</ref>  Ruling dynasties were often buried together, usually in monasteries; the [[Chartreuse de Champmol]] was founded for that purpose by the [[House of Valois|Valois]] [[Duke of Burgundy|Dukes of Burgundy]] in 1383.  The [[Scaliger tombs]] in [[Verona]] are magnificent free-standing [[Gothic art|Gothic]] canopied tombs—they are outside the church in a special enclosure, and so are unrestricted in height.<ref>Though they are exceeded in scale by [[Gothic revival]] monuments like the [[Albert Memorial]] and the [[Scott Monument]], neither containing a tomb.</ref> Important churches like Saint Peter\\'s in Rome, [[Saint Paul\\'s Cathedral, London]], [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice]] (twenty-five [[Doge]]s), and the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence]] contain large numbers of impressive monuments to the great and the good, created by the finest architects and sculptors available.  Local [[parish church]]es are also often full of monuments, which may include large and artistically significant ones for local landowners and notables.  Often a prominent family would add a special chapel for their use, including their tombs; in Catholic countries, bequests would pay for [[Catholic mass|masses]] to be said in perpetuity for their souls.  By the [[High Renaissance]], led by [[Michelangelo]]\\'s tombs, the effigies are often sitting up, and later may stand.  Often they turn towards the altar, or are kneeling facing it in profile.<ref>Hall, 325</ref>\\n[[Image:MULO-Philippe Gueldre Death Mirror.jpg|thumb|left|\"The Mirror of Death\": Detail from a French [[Renaissance]] monument of 1547|alt=Close-up of a rectangular-shaped carving in stone. In the center of the rectangle is a circle representing a mirror, and within the circle is a grinning skull. The circle is framed by ram\\'s horns.]]\\nIn the late Middle Ages, influenced by the [[Black Death]] and devotional writers, explicit \\'\\'[[memento mori]]\\'\\' imagery of death in the forms of skulls or skeletons, or even decomposing corpses overrun with worms in the \\'\\'[[transi]]\\'\\' tomb, became common in northern Europe, and may be found in some funerary art, as well as motifs like the [[Danse Macabre|Dance of Death]] and works like the \\'\\'[[Ars moriendi]]\\'\\', or \"Art of Dying\".<ref>Cohen throughout, see Introduction</ref>  It took until the Baroque period for such imagery to become popular in Italy, in works like the tomb of [[Pope Urban VIII]] by [[Bernini]] (1628–47), where a bronze winged skeleton inscribes the Pope\\'s name on a tablet below his enthroned effigy.<ref>Hall, 324–26</ref>\\n\\nThe church struggled to eliminate the pagan habits of leaving grave goods except for the clothing and usual jewellry of the powerful, especially rings.  Kings might be buried with a [[sceptre]], and bishops with a [[crozier]], their respective symbols of office.<ref>Piponnier & Mane, 112–113</ref>  The 7th century [[Stonyhurst Gospel]], with a unique [[Insular art|Insular]] original leather binding, was recovered from [[St Cuthbert\\'s coffin]], itself a significant object; it was probably Cuthbert\\'s personal copy, which he had very likely scribed himself.<ref>Bloxham, Jim & Rose, Krisine; [http://www.gbwny.org/news/2007/11/st-cuthbert-gospel-of-st-john-formerly-known-as-the-stonyhurst-gospel/ \\'\\'St. Cuthbert Gospel of St. John, Formerly Known as the Stonyhurst Gospel\\'\\']</ref>  The armour and sword of a knight might be hung over his tomb, as those of [[Edward, the Black Prince|the Black Prince]] still are in [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. The Early Christian Church, to the frustration of historians of costume, encouraged burial in a plain white [[winding-sheet]], as being all that would be required at the Second Coming.  For centuries, most except royalty followed this custom, which at least kept clothing, which was very expensive for rich and poor alike, available for the use of the living.  The use of a rich cloth [[Pall (funeral)|pall]] to cover the coffin during the funeral grew during the Middle Ages; initially these were brightly coloured and patterned, only later black.  They were usually then given to the Church to use for [[vestment]]s or other decorations.<ref>Piponnier & Mane, 34–35; 112–113</ref>   \\n\\nFrom the early 13th century to the 16th, a popular form of monument north of the Alps, especially for the smaller landowner and merchant classes, was the [[monumental brass]], a sheet of brass on which the image of the person or persons commemorated was engraved, often with inscriptions and an architectural surround.  They could be on the floor or wall inside a church. These provide valuable evidence as to changes in costume, especially for women.  Many bishops and even some German rulers were commemorated with brasses.<ref>\"Brasses, Monumental\"</ref>\\n \\n[[File:Pompe funebre for Katarzyna Opalińska.jpg|thumb|\\'\\'[[Castrum doloris]]\\'\\' for a Queen of Poland, erected in [[Notre Dame de Paris]] in 1747]]\\nThe \\'\\'[[castrum doloris]]\\'\\' was a temporary [[catafalque]] erected around the coffin for the [[lying in state]] of important people, usually in a church, the funerary version of the elaborate temporary decorations for other court festivities, like [[royal entries]].  These began in the late Middle Ages, but reached their height of elaboration in the 18th century.<ref>The corpse was in fact not always present. Bagliani, 158–159</ref> A particular feature in Poland was the [[coffin portrait]], a bust-length painted portrait of the deceased, attached to the coffin, but removed before burial and often then hung in the church.  Elsewhere, death masks were used in similar fashion.  [[Hatchment]]s were a special lozenge-shaped painted [[coat of arms]] which was displayed on the house of the deceased for a mourning period, before usually being moved to hang in the church.  Like [[mourning|mourning clothes]], these fall outside a strict definition of art.<ref>Piponnier & Mane, 113 for the origins of mourning clothes.</ref>\\n\\nFor some time after the [[Protestant Reformation]], [[English church monuments]] formed the majority of large-scale artworks added to Protestant churches, especially in sculpture.  The English upper classes ceased to commission altarpieces and other religious art for churches, but their tomb monuments continued to grow in size to fill the empty wall spaces; similar trends were seen in [[Lutheran]] countries, but [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] tended to be more disapproving of figure sculpture.<ref>See for example Michalski, xi. Here Michalski refers to this rejection of religious imagery within Calvinism as \"iconophobia\". See also Gäbler, 72,76–77 and Potter, 130–131 regarding the religious disputations in Zürich (1523) concerning (among other things) the removal of statues of saints and other icons. Participants included [[Leo Jud]] and [[Huldrych Zwingli]].</ref> Many portraits were painted after death, and sometimes dead family members were included along with the living; a variety of indications might be used to suggest the distinction.<ref>The [http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=3821 \\'\\'Saltonstall Family\\'\\'] is a well-known example. The [[Arnolfini Portrait]] has been claimed to be such a work</ref> \\n\\nThe large [[Baroque]] tomb monument continued likely to include a portrait of the deceased, and was more likely to include personified figures of Death, Time, Virtues or other figures than angels.  The late medieval [[transi]] tomb vocabulary of images of bodily decay, such as skulls and skeletons, was sometimes re-introduced, but in a less confrontational manner.<ref>Hall, 324–327</ref>  [[Neo-Classicism]], led by [[Antonio Canova]], revived the classical \\'\\'stela\\'\\', either with a portrait or a personification; in this style there was little or no difference between the demands of Catholic and Protestant patrons.<ref>Hall, 347–349; Berresford, 36–38</ref>  \\n\\n[[Image:Pere Lachaise Chemin Errazu.jpg|thumb|left|19th century [[bourgeois]] family tombs at [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris|alt=A cobbled street stretches out from the foreground and bends to the left. The street is lined with above-ground tombs, and a number of trees appear in the background.]]\\n\\nBy the 19th century, many [[Old World]] churchyards and church walls had completely run out of room for new monuments, and cemeteries on the outskirts of cities, towns or villages became the usual place for burials.<ref>\"Cemetery\"</ref>  The rich developed the classical styles of the ancient world for small family tombs, while the rest continued to use gravestones or what were now usually false sarcophagi, placed over a buried coffin.  The cemeteries of the large Italian cities are generally accepted to have outdone those of other nations in terms of extravagant statuary, especially the [[Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno]] in [[Genoa]], the [[Cimitero Monumentale di Milano]] and the [[Certosa di Bologna]].<ref>Berresford, throughout, and Prefaces</ref>  In Italy at least, funerary sculpture remained of equal status to other types during the 19th and early 20th centuries, and was made by the leading artists, often receiving reviews in the press, and being exhibited, perhaps in [[maquette]] form.<ref>Berresford, 13, and 58 on exhibitions</ref>  Monuments kept up with contemporary stylistic developments during the 19th century, embracing [[Symbolism]] enthusiatically, but then gradually became detached from the [[avant-garde]] after [[Art Nouveau]] and a few [[Art Deco]] examples.<ref>Berresford, 77–78 on \"Liberty\" (Italian term for \"Art Nouveau\") and 99–104 on Art Deco.</ref>  Where burials in church crypts or floors took place, memorial [[stained glass]] windows, mostly on normal religious subjects but with a commemorative panel, are often found.  [[War memorial]]s, other than on the site of a battle, were relatively unusual until the 19th century, but became increasingly common during it, and after [[World War I]] were erected even in villages of the main combatant nations.<ref>Mosse, Chapter 5</ref>\\n\\n=== Islam ===\\nIslamic funerary art is dominated by [[architecture]].  Grave goods are discouraged to the point that their absence is frequently one recognition criterion of Muslim burials.<ref>Insoll, 172</ref> Royalty and important religious figures were typically buried in plain stone sarcophagi, perhaps with a religious inscription.  However, funerary architecture often offered a means of \"moving beyond the strictures of formal Muslim burial rites\" and expressing social dimensions such as status, piety, love for the deceased, and Muslim identity.<ref>Insoll, 177–180</ref> A number of distinct architectural traditions arose for expressing these social elements.  The Islamic tradition was slow in starting; the \\'\\'[[hadith]]\\'\\' \"condemn the building of tombs, and [[Muhammed]] himself set the example of requesting burial in an unmarked grave in one of the chambers of his house\" in [[Medina]],<ref>Ruggles, 103</ref> though by at least the 12th century, buildings of the vast [[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi]] complex already marked the site.  The earliest identified Muslim monumental tomb, in [[Samarra]] in Iraq, only dates from 862, and was commissioned by the Byzantine princess whose son was buried there.<ref>Ruggles, 103–104</ref>  At some point, the tradition incorporated the idea of a garden setting, perhaps following the Islamic concept of [[Paradise]], an association certainly made when the tradition was mature, although the difficulty of reconstructing gardens from archaeology makes the early stages of this process hard to trace.  At any rate, gardens surrounding tombs became established in Islamic tradition in many parts of the world, and existing pleasure gardens were sometimes appropriated for this purpose.  Versions of the formal Persian \\'\\'[[charbagh]]\\'\\' design were widely used in India, Persia and elsewhere.<ref>Ruggles, Chapter 9</ref>    \\n\\n{{multiple image\\n|align = centre\\n|direction = horizontal\\n|header = \\n|header_align = centre\\n|header_background = \\n|footer = \\n|footer_align = \\n|footer_background = \\n|width = \\n|image1 = Bukhara - Samanid Mausoleum.jpg\\n|width1 = 170\\n|alt1 = \\n|caption1 = Brick [[Samanid Mausoleum]], c. 910, [[Bokhara]]\\n|\\n|image2 = Humayun\\'s Tomb.jpg \\n|width2 = 210\\n|alt2 =\\n|caption2 = [[Humayun\\'s Tomb]] (1560s), [[Dehli]], in its garden setting\\n|\\n|image3 = DSC04799 Istanbul - Cimitero di Eyüp - Foto G.

These single-chambered tombs developed into larger buildings in the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Empires,<ref name=\"Insoll, 177\">Insoll, 177</ref> like the [[Gur-e Amir]] tomb of [[Timur]] at [[Samarkand]] and the famous Mughal tombs of India, which culminated in the [[Taj Mahal]]. The Mughal tombs are mostly set in a large walled \\'\\'charbagh\\'\\' (\\'\\'chahar-bagh\\'\\') or [[Mughal gardens]], often with [[Pavilion (structure)|pavilion]]s at the corners<ref name=\"Insoll, 177\"/> and a gatehouse. The Taj Mahal is atypically placed at the end of the garden, backing onto the river [[Yamuna]]; a central placing is usual.<ref>Ruggles, 112 and 122. Her Chapter 10 includes a detailed description of the Taj with special reference to its gardens.</ref>  They may have [[minaret]]s, although they do not normally function as [[mosque]]s.  The [[Tomb of Jahangir]] lacks any dome,<ref>An interesting contrast with the Taj Mahal, given they were both built by [[Shah Jahan]].</ref> while the [[Tomb of Akbar the Great]] has only small decorative ones.  Other Islamic Indian rulers built similar tombs, of which the [[Gol Gumbaz]] is perhaps the most remarkable.\\n\\nIn all this tradition, the contemporary architectural style for mosques was adapted for a building with a smaller main room, and usually no courtyard.  Decoration was often tilework, and could include \\'\\'[[pietre dure|parchin kari]]\\'\\' inlays in semi-precious stone, painting, and decorative carving.  The sarcophagus might be in a small inner chamber, dimly visible through a grille of metal or stone, or might stand in the main room.  Money would be bequeathed to pay for continuous readings of the [[Qur\\'an]] in the mausoleum, and they were normally open for visitors to pay their respects. The [[Mausoleum of Khomeini]], still under construction in a [[Tehran]] cemetery, and intended to be the centre of a huge complex, continues these traditions.<ref name=\"NYT K\">The New York Times, [http://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/08/world/khomeini-s-tomb-attracts-pilgrims.html \\'\\'Khomeini\\'s Tomb Attracts Pilgrims\\'\\'], Philip Shenon, Published: July 8, 1990, accessed April 25, 2010.</ref>  \\n\\nThe tradition evolved differently in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] world, where smaller single-roomed \\'\\'[[türbe]]\\'\\' typically stand on the grounds of mosque complexes, often built by the deceased.  The sarcophagi (often purely symbolic, as the body is below the floor) may be draped in a rich pall, and surmounted by a real cloth or stone [[turban]], which is also traditional at the top of ordinary [[Turkish people|Turkish]] gravestones (usually in stylised form). Two of the most famous are in the [[Süleymaniye Mosque]] in [[Istanbul]]; the [[Yeşil Türbe]] (\"Green Tomb\") of 1421 is an unusually large example in [[Bursa]], and also unusual in having extensive tile work on the exterior, which is usually masonry, whereas the interiors are often decorated with brightly-colored tiles.<ref>Levey 1975, 29–33 on Bursa, 83–84 on Istanbul; all the leading Ottoman tombs are covered in the book.</ref>\\n\\nOther parts of the Islamic world reflected local techniques and traditions.  The 15th century royal [[Tomb of Askia]] in [[Mali]] used the local technique of mud-building to erect a 17 metre high pyramidal tomb set in a mosque complex.<ref>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1139 Tomb of Askia], [[UNESCO]] page with aerial view.</ref>  At the other end of the Islamic world, [[Java]]nese royalty are mostly buried in royal graveyards such as those at [[Kota Gede]] and [[Imogiri]]. \\n\\nIn the Arab world, mausoleums of rulers are more likely to be a side-room inside a mosque or form part of a larger complex containing perhaps a hospital, \\'\\'[[madrasa]]\\'\\' or library. Large domes, elaborately decorated inside, are common.  The tomb-mosque of Sultan [[Qaitbay]] (died 1496) is a famous example, one of many in [[Cairo]], though here the tomb chamber is unusually large compared to the whole.<ref>See Fletcher & Cruickshank, 596. The [[madrassa]] is labeled \"the ultimate achievement of architectural development in Cairo\" and its tomb chamber described as \"immense.\"</ref>\\n\\n==Modern period==\\n[[Image:Rachel whitereadwien holocaust mahnmal wien judenplatz.jpg|thumb|The [[Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial]] to the 65,000 Austrian Jews killed in the [[Holocaust]], designed by [[Rachel Whiteread]] and completed in 2000.]]\\nFunerary art tends to be conservative in style, and many grave markers in various cultures follow rather traditional patterns, while others reflect [[modernism]] or other recent styles.  Public monuments to the dead continue to be erected, especially [[war memorials]]. Some are fairly traditional, while those reflecting more contemporary styles include the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]], and several [[Holocaust memorials]], such as [[Yad Vashem]] in Jerusalem, the [[Vel%27_d%27Hiv_Roundup#Memorials_and_monuments_-_Paris|Vel d\\'Hiv Memorial]] in [[Paris]] (1994), the [[Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe]] in Berlin (2004), and the [[Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial]] in Vienna (2000). These are in notable contrast to the style of most war memorials to the military of World War II; earlier modernist memorials to the dead of World War I were sometimes removed after a time as inappropriate.<ref>Mosse, 103–106 on conservatism, and generally throughout Chapter 5 on war memorials.</ref>  Some war memorials, especially in countries like Germany, have had a turbulent political history, for example the much-rededicated [[Neue Wache]] in Berlin.<ref>Mosse, 97–98; Carrier, 201</ref> Several critics detect a crisis in public memorial style from 1945, when the traditional figurative symbolic language, and evocation of nationalist values, came to seem inadequate, especially in relation to [[genocide]], at least on the Western side of the [[Iron Curtain]].<ref>Carrier, 19–22; Benton throughout, especially p. 194.</ref> In the [[Communist]] East the established style of [[Socialist Realism]] was still considered appropriate, at least by the authorities.<ref>Benton throughout, especially Chapter 1 on Soviet War Memorials (pp. 12–13 on Socialist Realism), but also noting deviations in the Warsaw Pact satellites, as on p. 194, and Chapter 7 on West Germany.</ref> The generation of abstracted and [[Conceptual art|conceptual]] war and [[Holocaust]] memorials erected in the West from the 1990s onwards seems finally to have found a resolution for these issues.<ref>Carrier, throughout, especially Chapter 8.
