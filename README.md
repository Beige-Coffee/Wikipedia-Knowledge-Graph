# Wikipedia-Knowledge-Graph
Using 30,000 hand-graded Wikipedia articles and NLP to predict the quality of Wikipedia articles and create a knowledge graph that identifies both articles and topics in need of editorial and epistemological attention.


Please note that this is a work-in-progress.

## In A Nutshell
With roughly 50 million articles in Wikipedia's corupus, once can imagine how daunting of a task it must be to find the optimal balance between quality and quantity. For example, if you take a look at the following two articles, you can begin to see how disparate the range of quality is across Wikipedia articles. 
- High quality article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II
- Low quality article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring-tailed_cardinalfish

Now, at first thought, you may think that this difference in quality is not only understandable, but expected. And, if this was your thought, you'd be right. However, the more nuanced point is:
- 1) These articles were hand-selected to illucidate the point that a difference of quality exists
- 2) This difference in quality exists across many articles and, therefore, is not easy to readily detect

However, the advent of machine learning and predictive modeling has done a lot to level the scale between quality and quantity. In hopes of contributing towards this endeavor and, *just as importantly*, **building a project that can be intuitively understood by any wikipedia editor**, I have built a machine learning model to predict the quality score of a Wikipedia article and, subsequently, organize article predictions by category on a user-friendly website.
