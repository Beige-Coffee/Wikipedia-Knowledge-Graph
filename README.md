# Wikipedia-Knowledge-Graph
Using 30,000 hand-graded Wikipedia articles and NLP to predict the quality of Wikipedia articles and create a knowledge graph that identifies both articles and topics in need of editorial and epistemological attention.


Please note that this is a work-in-progress. 

Thanks,
