[[Tomb]] is a general term for the repository, while [[grave goods]] are objects—other than the primary human remains—which have been placed inside.<ref>Hammond, 58–9 characterizes [[Dismemberment|disarticulated]] human skeletal remains packed in body bags and incorporated into [[Formative stage|Pre-Classic]] [[Mesoamerica]]n [[mass burial]]s (along with a set of primary remains) at Cuello, [[Belize]] as \"human grave goods\".</ref> Such objects may include the personal possessions of the deceased, objects specially created for the burial, or miniature versions of things believed to be needed in an [[afterlife]].  Knowledge of many non-literate cultures is drawn largely from these sources.\n",

      "Funerary art can serve many cultural functions.  It can play a role in burial rites, serve as an article for use by the dead in the afterlife, and celebrate the life and accomplishments of the dead, whether as part of kinship-centered practices of [[ancestor veneration]] or as a publicly directed [[Dynasty|dynastic]] display.  It can also function as a reminder of the mortality of humankind, as an expression of cultural values and roles, and help to propitiate the spirits of the dead, maintaining their benevolence and preventing their unwelcome intrusion into the affairs of the living.  \n",

A similar division can be seen in grand East Asian tombs. In other cultures nearly all the art connected with the burial, except for limited grave goods, was intended to remain visible to the public, or at least those admitted by the custodians.  In these cultures traditions such as the sculpted  [[sarcophagus]] and [[tomb monument]]s of the Greek and Roman empires, and later the Christian world, have flourished.

This effect was often achieved by encapsulating a single corpse in a basic pit, surrounded by an elaborate ditch and drain. Over-ground commemoration is thought to be tied to the concept of collective memory, and these early tombs were likely intended as a form of [[ancestor-worship]], a development available only to communities that had advanced to the stage of settled livestock and formed social roles and relationships and specialized sectors of activity.<ref>Mohen, 87</ref>\n",

Compared to the Etruscans, though, there was less emphasis on provision of a lifestyle for the deceased, although paintings of useful objects or pleasant activities, like hunting, are seen.<ref>Toynbee, 38</ref>  Ancestor portraits, usually in the form of wax masks, were kept in the home, apparently often in little cupboards,<ref>Toynbee, 31&nbsp;(illustration)</ref> although grand patrician families kept theirs on display in the ''[[Domus|atrium]]''.  They were worn in the funeral processions of members of the family by persons wearing appropriate costume for the figure represented, as described by [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Polybius]].  Pliny also describes the custom of having a bust-portrait of an ancestor painted on a round bronze shield (''[[clipeus]]''), and having it hung in a temple or other public place.

Examples include the [[Tomb of Eurysaces the Baker]], a [[freedman]], the [[Pyramid of Cestius]], and the Mausoleum of [[Caecilia Metella (daughter of Metellus Creticus)|Caecilia Metella]], all built within a few decades of the start of the [[Common Era]].<ref>Petersen, 95—105; see also Boardman, 240—241 on Eurysaces' tomb.</ref>    \n",

The [[Scaliger tombs]] in [[Verona]] are magnificent free-standing [[Gothic art|Gothic]] canopied tombs—they are outside the church in a special enclosure, and so are unrestricted in height.<ref>Though they are exceeded in scale by [[Gothic revival]] monuments like the [[Albert Memorial]] and the [[Scott Monument]], neither containing a tomb.</ref> Important churches like Saint Peter's in Rome, [[Saint Paul's Cathedral, London]], [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice]] (twenty-five [[Doge]]s), and the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence]] contain large numbers of impressive monuments to the great and the good, created by the finest architects and sculptors available.  Local [[parish church]]es are also often full of monuments, which may include large and artistically significant ones for local landowners and notables.  Often a prominent family would add a special chapel for their use, including their tombs; in Catholic countries, bequests would pay for [[Catholic mass|masses]] to be said in perpetuity for their souls.  By the [[High Renaissance]], led by [[Michelangelo]]'s tombs, the effigies are often sitting up, and later may stand.  Often they turn towards the altar, or are kneeling facing it in profile.<ref>Hall, 325</ref>\n",

      "In the late Middle Ages, influenced by the [[Black Death]] and devotional writers, explicit ''[[memento mori]]'' imagery of death in the forms of skulls or skeletons, or even decomposing corpses overrun with worms in the ''[[transi]]'' tomb, became common in northern Europe, and may be found in some funerary art, as well as motifs like the [[Danse Macabre|Dance of Death]] and works like the ''[[Ars moriendi]]'', or \"Art of Dying\".<ref>Cohen throughout, see Introduction</ref>  It took until the Baroque period for such imagery to become popular in Italy, in works like the tomb of [[Pope Urban VIII]] by [[Bernini]] (1628–47), where a bronze winged skeleton inscribes the Pope's name on a tablet below his enthroned effigy.<ref>Hall, 324–26</ref>\n",

The Early Christian Church, to the frustration of historians of costume, encouraged burial in a plain white [[winding-sheet]], as being all that would be required at the Second Coming.  For centuries, most except royalty followed this custom, which at least kept clothing, which was very expensive for rich and poor alike, available for the use of the living.  The use of a rich cloth [[Pall (funeral)|pall]] to cover the coffin during the funeral grew during the Middle Ages; initially these were brightly coloured and patterned, only later black.

They could be on the floor or wall inside a church. These provide valuable evidence as to changes in costume, especially for women.

The English upper classes ceased to commission altarpieces and other religious art for churches, but their tomb monuments continued to grow in size to fill the empty wall spaces; similar trends were seen in [[Lutheran]] countries, but [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] tended to be more disapproving of figure sculpture.<ref>See for example Michalski, xi.

      "Islamic funerary art is dominated by [[architecture]].  Grave goods are discouraged to the point that their absence is frequently one recognition criterion of Muslim burials.<ref>Insoll, 172</ref> Royalty and important religious figures were typically buried in plain stone sarcophagi, perhaps with a religious inscription.  However, funerary architecture often offered a means of \"moving beyond the strictures of formal Muslim burial rites\" and expressing social dimensions such as status, piety, love for the deceased, and Muslim identity.<ref>Insoll, 177–180</ref> A number of distinct architectural traditions arose for expressing these social elements.  The Islamic tradition was slow in starting; the ''[[hadith]]'' \"condemn the building of tombs, and [[Muhammed]] himself set the example of requesting burial in an unmarked grave in one of the chambers of his house\" in [[Medina]],<ref>Ruggles, 103</ref> though by at least the 12th century, buildings of the vast [[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi]] complex already marked the site.  The earliest identified Muslim monumental tomb, in [[Samarra]] in Iraq, only dates from 862, and was commissioned by the Byzantine princess whose son was buried there.<ref>Ruggles, 103–104</ref>  At some point, the tradition incorporated the idea of a garden setting, perhaps following the Islamic concept of [[Paradise]], an association certainly made when the tradition was mature, although the difficulty of reconstructing gardens from archaeology makes the early stages of this process hard to trace.  At any rate, gardens surrounding tombs became established in Islamic tradition in many parts of the world, and existing pleasure gardens were sometimes appropriated for this purpose.  Versions of the formal Persian ''[[charbagh]]'' design were widely used in India, Persia and elsewhere.<ref>Ruggles, Chapter 9</ref>    \n",

The sarcophagus might be in a small inner chamber, dimly visible through a grille of metal or stone, or might stand in the main room.  Money would be bequeathed to pay for continuous readings of the [[Qur'an]] in the mausoleum, and they were normally open for visitors to pay their respects.
