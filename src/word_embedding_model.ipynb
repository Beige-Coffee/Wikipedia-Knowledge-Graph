[[Tomb]] is a general term for the repository, while [[grave goods]] are objects—other than the primary human remains—which have been placed inside.<ref>Hammond, 58–9 characterizes [[Dismemberment|disarticulated]] human skeletal remains packed in body bags and incorporated into [[Formative stage|Pre-Classic]] [[Mesoamerica]]n [[mass burial]]s (along with a set of primary remains) at Cuello, [[Belize]] as \"human grave goods\".</ref> Such objects may include the personal possessions of the deceased, objects specially created for the burial, or miniature versions of things believed to be needed in an [[afterlife]].  Knowledge of many non-literate cultures is drawn largely from these sources.\\n\\nFunerary art can serve many cultural functions.  It can play a role in burial rites, serve as an article for use by the dead in the afterlife, and celebrate the life and accomplishments of the dead, whether as part of kinship-centered practices of [[ancestor veneration]] or as a publicly directed [[Dynasty|dynastic]] display.  It can also function as a reminder of the mortality of humankind, as an expression of cultural values and roles, and help to propitiate the spirits of the dead, maintaining their benevolence and preventing their unwelcome intrusion into the affairs of the living.  \\n\\nThe deposit of objects with an apparent aesthetic intention may go back to the [[Neanderthal]]s over 50,000 years ago,<ref>Depending on the interpretation of sites like the [[Shanidar Cave]] in Iraq. Bogucki, 64–66 summarizes the debate.  Gargett takes a hostile view but accepts (p. 29 etc.) that many or most scholars do not. See also Pettitt.</ref> and is found in almost all subsequent cultures—the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] culture, which has little, is a notable exception.<ref>\"[Hindu] disposal of their dead by cremation and a belief in reincarnation tended to obviate an inherent interest in permanent markers\". Groseclose, 23</ref> Many of the best-known artistic creations of past cultures—from the [[Egyptian pyramids]] and the [[KV62|Tutankhamun treasure]] to the [[Terracotta Army]] surrounding the tomb of the [[Qin Shi Huang|Qin Emperor]], the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]], the [[Sutton Hoo]] ship burial and the [[Taj Mahal]]—are tombs or objects found in and around them.  In most instances, specialized funeral art was produced for the powerful and wealthy, although the burials of ordinary people might include simple monuments and grave goods, usually from their possessions.\\n\\nAn important factor in the development of traditions of funerary art is the division between what was intended to be visible to visitors or the public after completion of the [[funeral]] ceremonies.<ref>See for example the chapter \"Tombs for the Living and the Dead\", Insoll 176–87</ref>  The [[Tutankhamun]] treasure, for example, though exceptionally lavish, was never intended to be seen again by humans after it was deposited, while the exterior of the Pyramids were a permanent and highly effective demonstration of the power of their creators.  A similar division can be seen in grand East Asian tombs. In other cultures nearly all the art connected with the burial, except for limited grave goods, was intended to remain visible to the public, or at least those admitted by the custodians.  In these cultures traditions such as the sculpted  [[sarcophagus]] and [[tomb monument]]s of the Greek and Roman empires, and later the Christian world, have flourished. The [[mausoleum]] intended for visiting was the grandest type of tomb in the classical world, and later common in [[Islam]]ic culture.\\n\\n==Common terms==\\nA [[tumulus]], mound, [[kurgan]], or [[long barrow]] covered important [[burial]]s in many cultures, and the body may be placed in a sarcophagus, usually of stone, or a [[coffin]], usually of wood.  A mausoleum is a building erected mainly as a tomb, taking its name from the Mausoleum of Mausolus at [[Halicarnassus]].  [[Stele]] is a term for erect stones that are often what are now called [[gravestone]]s.  [[Ship burial]]s are mostly found in coastal Europe, while [[chariot burial]]s are found widely across [[Eurasia]]. [[Catacombs]], of which the most famous examples are those in [[Catacombs of Rome|Rome]] and [[Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa|Alexandria]], are underground cemeteries connected by tunnelled passages.  A large group of burials with traces remaining above ground can be called a [[necropolis]]; if there are no such visible structures, it is a [[grave field]].  A [[cenotaph]] is a memorial without a burial.<ref>See any well-regarded survey of the [[history of art]] or of [[history of architecture|architecture]], such as \\'\\'[[Gardner\\'s Art Through the Ages]]\\'\\' or the most recent edition of Sir [[Banister Fletcher]]\\'s \\'\\'A History of Architecture.\\'\\'</ref>\\n\\nRelated genres of commemorative art for the dead take many forms, such as the \\'\\'[[moai]]\\'\\' figures of [[Easter Island]], apparently a type of sculpted [[ancestor portrait]], though hardly individualized.<ref>[http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aoa/h/hoa_hakananaia.aspx Hoa Hakananai\\'a] British Museum, accessed 26 April, 2010</ref>  These are common in cultures as diverse as Ancient Rome and China, in both of which they are kept in the houses of the descendants, rather than being buried.<ref>Toynbee, 47–48, on Ancient Rome. Stewart and Rawski\\'s book is entirely devoted to Chinese ancestor portraits. See Chapter 1 etc.</ref>  Many cultures have [[psychopomp]] figures, such as the Greek [[Hermes]] and Etruscan [[Charun]], who help conduct the spirits of the dead into the afterlife.\\n\\n== Pre-history==\\n{{Main|Megalith}}\\n[[Image:paulnabrone.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Poulnabrone dolmen]] in Ireland covered at least 22 bodies of the [[Neolithic]] period]]\\n\\nMost of humanity\\'s oldest known archaeological constructions are tombs.<ref>Although the purpose of megalithic structures is not always clear, and of the very oldest, while [[Nevali Cori]] in Turkey contains burials, [[Göbekli Tepe]] appears not to.</ref> Mostly [[megalith]]ic, the earliest instances date to within a few centuries of each other, yet show a wide diversity of form and purpose. Tombs in the [[Iberian peninsula]] have been dated through [[thermoluminescence]] to c. 4510 BCE, and some burials at the [[Carnac stones]] in [[Brittany]] also date back to the fifth millennium BCE.<ref>Mohen, 70</ref> The commemorative value of such burial sites are indicated by the fact that, at some stage, they became elevated, and that the constructs, almost from the earliest, sought to be monumental. This effect was often achieved by encapsulating a single corpse in a basic pit, surrounded by an elaborate ditch and drain. Over-ground commemoration is thought to be tied to the concept of collective memory, and these early tombs were likely intended as a form of [[ancestor-worship]], a development available only to communities that had advanced to the stage of settled livestock and formed social roles and relationships and specialized sectors of activity.<ref>Mohen, 87</ref>\\n\\nIn [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] societies, a great variety of tombs are found, with tumulus mounds, megaliths and pottery as recurrent elements. In Eurasia, a [[dolmen]] is the exposed stone framework for a [[chamber tomb]] originally covered by earth to make a mound which no longer exists.  Stones may be carved with geometric patterns ([[petroglyph]]s), for example [[cup and ring mark]]s.  Group tombs were made, the social context of which is hard to decipher. [[Urn]] burials, where bones are buried in a pottery container, either in a more elaborate tomb, or by themselves, are widespread, by no means restricted to the [[Urnfield culture]] which is named after them, or even to Eurasia.  [[Menhir]]s, or \"[[standing stone]]s\", seem often to mark graves or serve as memorials,<ref>Kipfer, \"Menhir\", 348</ref> while the later [[runestone]]s and [[image stone]]s often are [[cenotaph]]s, or memorials apart from the grave itself; these continue into the Christian period. The [[Senegambian stone circles]] are a later African form of tomb markers.<ref>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1226 Stone Circles of Senegambia – UNESCO World Heritage Centre], accessed April 28, 2010</ref>\\n\\n== Ancient Egypt and Nubia==\\n{{main|Art of ancient Egypt}}\\n[[Image:Egypte louvre 239 masque.jpg|thumb|Egyptian ceramic coffin mask|alt=An oversized, shallow mask depicting a large face. The face is roughly oval-shaped, but the top of the mask is a horizontal line just above the eyebrows, leaving the entire mask roughly triangular. The entire face is flattened, but the bulbous nose protrudes away from the face. The eyes are large and almond shaped, and both the eyes and braided eyebrows are disproportionally large in comparison with the mouth, which has full lips. The front of the face is clean-shaven, but below the chin, there is a long, narrow, pointed, braided false beard that was characteristic of ancient Egyptian royalty.]]\\n\\nEgyptian funerary art was inseparably connected to the [[Ancient Egyptian religion|religious belief]] that life continued after death – even more, it expressed a belief that \"death is a mere phase of life\".<ref>Groenewegen-Frankfort, 80</ref> Aesthetic objects and images connected with this belief were partially intended to preserve material goods, wealth and status for the journey between this life and the next,<ref>Stone, 37</ref> and to \"commemorate the life of the tomb owner ... depict performance of the burial rites, and in general present an environment that would be conducive to the tomb owner\\'s rebirth.\"<ref>Kampen&nbsp;et&nbsp;al, 31</ref> In this context, Egyptian [[mummy|mummies]] encased in one or more layers of decorated coffin, are famous; [[canopic jar]]s preserved the internal organs. A special category of [[Ancient Egyptian funerary texts]] clarify the purposes of the burial customs.  The early [[mastaba]] type of tomb had a sealed underground burial chamber but an offering-chamber on the ground level for visits by the living, a pattern repeated in later types of tomb. An effigy of the deceased might be walled up in a \\'\\'[[serdab]]\\'\\' connected to the offering chamber by vents that allowed the smell of [[incense]] to reach the effigy.<ref>Maspero, 111—127, with \\'\\'serdabs\\'\\' 124—125</ref>   The walls of important tomb-chambers and offering chambers were heavily decorated with [[relief]]s in stone or sometimes wood, or paintings, depicting religious scenes, portraits of the deceased, and at some periods vivid images of everyday life, depicting the afterlife. The chamber decoration usually centred on a \"false door\", through which only the soul of the deceased could pass, to received the offerings left by the living.<ref>Robins, 51–55, 66–71, 218–219, and see index for other periods. Tomb styles changed considerably over the course of Egyptian history.</ref> \\n\\n[[Representation (arts)|Representational art]], such as individual portraiture of the deceased, is found extremely early on and continues into the Roman period in the [[Encaustic painting|encaustic]] [[Faiyum mummy portraits|Faiyum funerary portraits]] applied to coffins. However, it is still hotly debated whether there was realistic [[portraiture in Ancient Egypt]].<ref>Spanel, 23</ref>  The purpose of the life-sized [[reserve head]]s found in burial shafts or tombs of nobles of the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|Fourth dynasty]] is not well understood; they may have been a discreet method of eliding an edict by [[Khufu]] forbidding nobles from creating statues of themselves, or may have protected the deceased\\'s spirit from harm or magically eliminated any evil in it, or perhaps functioned as alternate containers for the spirit if the body should be harmed in any way.<ref>Atiya & El Shawahy, 73</ref> \\n \\nArchitectural works such as the massive [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] and two smaller ones built during the [[Old Kingdom]] in the [[Giza Necropolis]] and (much later, from about 1500&nbsp;BCE) the tombs in the [[Valley of the Kings]] were built for royalty and the elite. The [[Theban Necropolis]] was later an important site for [[mortuary temple]]s and mastaba tombs.  The [[Kushite]] kings who conquered Egypt and ruled as pharaohs during the [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-fifth dynasty]] were greatly influenced by Egyptian funerary customs, employing mummification, canopic jars and \\'\\'[[ushabti]]\\'\\' funerary figurines. They also built the [[Nubian pyramids]], which in both size and design more closely resemble the smaller [[Seventeenth dynasty of Egypt|Seventeenth dynasty]] pyramids at Thebes than those of the Old Kingdom near Memphis.<ref>Boardman, Edwards \\'\\'et al\\'\\', 688–9</ref>\\n\\nLower-class citizens used common forms of funerary art—including \\'\\'[[shabti]]\\'\\' figurines (to perform any labor that might be required of the dead person in the afterlife), [[Dung beetle#Scarab in Ancient Egypt|models of the scarab beetle]] and books of the dead—which they believed would protect them in the afterlife.<ref>James, 122</ref> During the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], miniature wooden or clay models depicting scenes from everyday life became popular additions to tombs. In an attempt to duplicate the activities of the living in the afterlife, these models show laborers, houses, boats and even military formations which are scale representations of the ideal ancient Egyptian afterlife.<ref>Robins, 74</ref>\\n\\n==Ancient Greece==\\n[[Image:NAMA Hermès & Myrrhinè.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Relief from a carved funerary \\'\\'[[lekythos]]\\'\\' at the [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]]: [[Hermes]] conducts the deceased, \\'\\'Myrrhine\\'\\', to [[Hades]], c. 430–420 BCE|alt=A carving of a noble robed man and woman apparently leading a demure, robed woman. The man\\'s robe is open, exposing his penis. He holds the hand of the woman.]]\\n\\nThe ancient Greeks did not generally leave elaborate grave goods, except for a [[Charon\\'s obol|coin to pay Charon]], the [[Charon (mythology)|ferryman to Hades]], and pottery; however the \\'\\'epitaphios\\'\\' or [[Funeral oration (ancient Greece)|funeral oration]]&nbsp;from which the word [[epitaph]] comes&nbsp;was regarded as of great importance, and [[animal sacrifice]]s were made.   Those who could afford them erected stone monuments, which was one of the functions of \\'\\'[[kouros]]\\'\\' statues in the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic period]] before about 500&nbsp;BCE.  These were not intended as portraits, but during the [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic period]], realistic portraiture of the deceased was introduced and family groups were often depicted in [[bas-relief]] on monuments, usually surrounded by an architectural frame.<ref>Boardman, 212, 15</ref>  The walls of tomb chambers were often painted in [[fresco]], although few examples have survived in as good condition as the [[Tomb of the Diver]] from southern Italy or the tombs at [[Vergina]] in Macedon.  Almost the only surviving painted portraits in the classical Greek tradition are found in Egypt rather than Greece. The [[Fayum mummy portraits]], from the very end of the classical period, were portrait faces, in a [[Greco-Roman world|Graeco-Roman]] style, attached to mummies.<ref>Oakes & Gahlin, 236</ref>\\n\\nEarly Greek burials were frequently marked above ground by a large piece of [[Pottery of ancient Greece|pottery]], and remains were also buried in urns.  Pottery continued to be used extensively inside tombs and graves throughout the classical period.<ref>Boardman, 26 and passim</ref>   The \\'\\'[[Larnax (Archaeology)|larnax]]\\'\\' is a small coffin or ash-chest, usually of decorated [[terracotta]]. The two-handled \\'\\'[[loutrophoros]]\\'\\' was primarily associated with weddings, as it was used to carry water for the [[nuptial]] bath. However, it was also placed in the tombs of the unmarried, \"presumably to make up in some way for what they had missed in life.\"<ref>Richter, 57</ref> The one-handled \\'\\'[[lekythos]]\\'\\' had many household uses, but outside the household, its principal use was the decoration of tombs.<ref>Henderson, 135</ref> Scenes of a [[descent to the underworld]] of [[Hades]] were often painted on these, with the dead depicted beside [[Hermes]], Charon or both—though usually only with Charon.<ref>Wright, 391</ref> Small pottery figurines are often found, though it is hard to decide if these were made especially for placement in tombs; in the case of the [[Hellenistic]] [[Tanagra figurines]], this seems probably not the case.<ref>Boardman, 212–13</ref> But silverware is more often found around the fringes of the Greek world, as in the royal [[Macedon]]ian tombs of [[Vergina]], or in the neighbouring cultures such as those of [[Thrace]] or the [[Scythians]].<ref>Boardman, 149–50</ref>\\n\\nThe extension of the Greek world after the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] brought peoples with different tomb-making traditions into the [[Hellenistic]] sphere, resulting in new formats for art in Greek styles.<ref>Boardman, 151–154, and throughout the section on the period</ref>  A generation before Alexander, Mausolus was a Hellenized [[satrap]] or semi-independent ruler under the [[Persian Empire]], whose enormous tomb (begun 353 BCE) was wholly exceptional in the Greek world – together with the Pyramids it was the only tomb to be be included in the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]].  The exact form of the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]], which gave the name to the form, is now unclear, and there are several alternative reconstructions that seek to reconcile the archaeological evidence with descriptions in literature.<ref>Boardman, 126–127. Apart from those at the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]] article, there are several from Lethaby\\'s 1908 work [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Turkey/_Periods/Greek/_Texts/LETGKB/Mausoleum*.html here], and one illustrated in Boardman.</ref>  It had the size and some elements of the design of the [[Greek temple]], but was much more vertical, with a square base and a pyramidal roof.  There were quantities of large sculpture.<ref>Boardman, 126–127</ref>  Other local rulers adapted the high-relief temple [[frieze]] for very large sarcophagi, starting a tradition which was to exert a great influence on Western art up to 18th century [[Neo-Classicism]].  The late 4th century [[Alexander Sarcophagus]] was in fact made for another Hellenized Eastern ruler, one of a number of important sarcophagi found at [[Sidon]] in the modern [[Lebanon]].  The two long sides show Alexander\\'s great victory at the [[Battle of Issus]] and a lion hunt; such violent scenes were common on ostentatious classical sarcophagi from this period onwards, with a particular revival in Roman art of the 2nd century.  More peaceful mythological scenes were popular on smaller sarcophagi, especially of [[Bacchus]].<ref>Boardman, 172–173, 339–344</ref>\\n\\n==Etruscan==\\n[[Image:Banditaccia Sarcofago Degli Sposi.jpg|thumb|The [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] \"[[Sarcophagus of the Spouses]]\", at the [[National Etruscan Museum]] in Italy.|alt=A sculpture of a woman and man reclining together on a couch, their upper bodies to the right and their legs to the left.

Often a couple are shown, signifying a longing for reunion in the afterlife rather than a double burial.<ref>Toynbee, Chapter IV; Hall, 53</ref> \\n\\nIn later periods, life-size sculptures of the deceased reclining as though at a meal or social gathering are found, a common Etruscan style.  Family tombs for the grandest late Roman families, like the [[Tomb of the Scipios]], were large mausoleums with facilities for visits by the living, including kitchens and bedrooms.  The [[Castel Sant\\'Angelo]], built for [[Hadrian]], was later converted into a fortress.  Compared to the Etruscans, though, there was less emphasis on provision of a lifestyle for the deceased, although paintings of useful objects or pleasant activities, like hunting, are seen.<ref>Toynbee, 38</ref>  Ancestor portraits, usually in the form of wax masks, were kept in the home, apparently often in little cupboards,<ref>Toynbee, 31&nbsp;(illustration)</ref> although grand patrician families kept theirs on display in the \\'\\'[[Domus|atrium]]\\'\\'.  They were worn in the funeral processions of members of the family by persons wearing appropriate costume for the figure represented, as described by [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Polybius]].  Pliny also describes the custom of having a bust-portrait of an ancestor painted on a round bronze shield (\\'\\'[[clipeus]]\\'\\'), and having it hung in a temple or other public place.  No examples of either type have survived.<ref>Hall, 15, 35, 78</ref> \\n\\nBy the late [[Roman Republic|Republic]] there was considerable competition among wealthy Romans for the best locations for tombs, which lined all the approach roads to the city up to the walls, and a variety of exotic and unusual designs sought to catch the attention of the passer-by and so perpetuate the memory of the deceased and increase the prestige of their family.  Examples include the [[Tomb of Eurysaces the Baker]], a [[freedman]], the [[Pyramid of Cestius]], and the Mausoleum of [[Caecilia Metella (daughter of Metellus Creticus)|Caecilia Metella]], all built within a few decades of the start of the [[Common Era]].<ref>Petersen, 95—105; see also Boardman, 240—241 on Eurysaces\\' tomb.</ref>    \\n\\nIn Italy, sarcophagi were mostly intended to be set against the wall of the tomb, and only decorated on three sides, in contrast to the free-standing styles of Greece and the Eastern Empire. The relief scenes of Hellenistic art became even more densely crowded in later Roman sarcophagi, as for example in the 2nd century [[Portonaccio sarcophagus]], and various styles and forms emerged, such as the columnar type with an \"architectural background of columns and niches for its figures\".<ref>Boardman, 339</ref>  A well-known Early Christian example is the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]], used for an important new convert who died in 359. Many sarcophagi from leading centres were exported around the Empire.<ref>Boardman, 339–344; Hall, 78–80</ref>  The Romans had already developed the expression of religious and philosophical ideas in narrative scenes from [[Greek mythology]], treated [[allegorically]];<ref>Hall, 54–61</ref> they later transferred this habit to Christian ideas, using Biblical scenes.<ref>Hall, 77–82</ref>\\n\\n==China==\\n[[File:SAM Art Ladder military guardian.jpg|thumb|\"Military Guardian\", Chinese funerary statue. Seattle Art Museum, Seattle, Washington.]]\\nFunerary art varied greatly across Chinese history. Tombs of early rulers rival the ancient Egyptians for complexity and value of grave goods, and have been similarly pillaged over the centuries by [[tomb robber]]s.  For a long time, literary references to [[jade burial suit]]s were regarded by scholars as fanciful myths, but a number of examples were excavated in the 20th century, and it is now believed that they were relatively common among early rulers.  Knowledge of pre-dynastic Chinese culture has been expanded by spectacular discoveries at [[Sanxingdui]] and other sites.  Very large tumuli could be erected, and later, mausoleums.  Several special large shapes of [[Shang dynasty]] bronze ritual vessels may have been made for burial only; the [[Tomb of Fu Hao]] (c BCE 1200) is one of the few undisturbed royal tombs of the period to have been excavated—most funerary art has appeared on the art market without archaeological context.<ref>See for example  Merriman, 297</ref> \\n\\nThe discovery in 1974 of the [[Terracotta army]] located the tomb of the [[First Qin Emperor]] (died 210 BCE), but the main tumulus, of which literary descriptions survive,  has not been excavated.  Remains surviving above ground from several imperial tombs of the [[Han dynasty]] show traditions maintained until the end of imperial rule.  The tomb itself is an \"underground palace\" beneath a sealed tumulus surrounded by a wall, with several buildings set at some distance away down avenues for the observation of rites of veneration, and the accomodation of both permanent staff and those visiting to perform rites, as well as gateways, towers and other buildings.  This complex is approached by a \"spirit road\", sometimes several kilometres long, lined by statues of guardian figures, based on both humans and animals, and [[Bixi (tortoise)|\\'\\'bixi\\'\\']] or stelae mounted on tortoises. In Han tombs the guardian figures are mainly of \"lions\" and \"[[chimera]]s\"; in later periods they are much more varied.<ref>Sickman & Soper, 57-66; see also [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4gNk5HzIIKgC&pg=PA31&dq=Han+cemetery+marker+que&lr=&ei=LeLfS_P-NYvONd_D-M8K&cd=4#v=onepage&q&f=false the diagram here]</ref>  A looted tomb with fine paintings is the [[Empress Dowager Wenming tomb]] of the 5th century CE, and the many tombs of the 7th century [[Tang dynasty]] [[Qianling Mausoleum]] group are an early example of a generally well-preserved ensemble.<ref>Sickman & Soper, 155</ref>  The [[complex of Goguryeo Tombs]], from a kingdom of the 5th to 7th centuries which included modern [[Korea]], are especially rich in paintings.  Only one of the [[Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties]] has been excavated, in 1956, with such [[Ming Dynasty Tombs|disastrous results]] for the conservation of the thousands of objects found, that the current policy is to leave them undisturbed.<ref>Evasdottir, 158—160</ref>   \\n\\nThe [[Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum]] in Hong Kong displays a far humbler middle-class Han dynasty tomb, and the mid-2nd century Wu Family tombs of [[Jiaxiang County]], [[Shandong]] are the most important group of commoner tombs for funerary stones.  The walls of both the offering and burial chambers of tombs of commoners from the Han period may be decorated with stone slabs carved or engraved in very low relief with crowded and varied scenes, which are now the main indication of the style of the lost palace frescos of the period.  A cheaper option was to use large clay tiles which were carved or impressed before firing.<ref>Sickman & Soper, 77-84</ref>  After the introduction of Buddhism, carved \"funerary couches\" featured similar scenes, now mostly religious.<ref>Sickman & Soper, 120-121</ref> During the Han Dynasty, [[Science_and_technology_of_the_Han_Dynasty#Ceramic_model_buildings|miniature ceramic models]] of buildings were often made to accompany the deceased in the graves; to them is owed much of what is known of ancient Chinese architecture. Later, during the [[Six Dynasties]], sculptural miniatures depicting buildings, monuments, people and animals adorned the tops of the \\'\\'[[hunping]]\\'\\' funerary vessels.<ref name=dien>Dien, 214–215</ref>  The outsides of tombs often featured monumental brick or stone-carved pillar-gates (que 闕); an example from 121 CE appears to be the earliest surviving Chinese architectural structure standing above ground.<ref>Sickman & Soper, 376 (illustrated)</ref> \\n\\nEarly burial customs show a strong belief in an afterlife and a spirit path to it that needed facilitating.

There is usually one or more T-shaped shrine buildings some distance in front of the tomb, which is set in extensive grounds, usually with a hill behind them, and facing a view towards water and distant hills.  They are still a focus for [[ancestor worship]] rituals.

Funerals are one of the areas in Japanese life where Buddhist customs are followed even by those who followed other traditions, such as [[Shinto]].  The \\'\\'[[bodaiji]]\\'\\' is a special and very common type of temple whose main purpose is as a venue for rites of ancestor worship, though it is often not the actual burial site.  This was originally a custom of the feudal lords, but was adopted by other classes from about the 16th century. Each family would use a particular \\'\\'bodaiji\\'\\' over generations, and it might contain a second \"grave\" if the actual burial were elsewhere.

Instead, most Mesoamerican funerary art takes the form of grave goods and, in [[Oaxaca]], funerary urns. Two well-known examples of Mesoamerican grave goods are those from [[Jaina Island]], a [[Maya civilization|Maya]] site off the coast of [[Campeche]], and those associated with the [[Western Mexico shaft tomb tradition]].<!-- read te FAC before putting a {{fact}} tag here -->  The tombs of Mayan rulers can only normally be identified by inferences drawn from the lavishness of the grave goods and, with the possible exception of vessels made from stone rather than pottery, these appear to contain no objects specially made for the burial.<ref>Chase and Chase, Chapter 3, especially p. 34</ref>\\n\\nThe Jaina Island graves are noted for their abundance of clay figurines.

Of particular note are the various ceramic tableaux including village scenes, for example, players engaged in a [[Mesoamerican ballgame]].  Although these tableaux may merely depict village life, it has been proposed that they instead (or also) depict the underworld.<ref>See Taylor for discussion.</ref> Ceramic dogs are also widely known from looted tombs, and are thought by some to represent [[psychopomp]]s (soul guides),<ref>Coe et al., 103–104, or Mason, 182.

Numerous types of urns have been identified.<ref>Kubler, 163</ref> While some show deities and other supernatural beings, others seem to be portraits.  Art historian [[George Kubler]] is particularly enthusiastic about the craftsmanship of this tradition:\\n\\n<blockquote>No other American potters ever explored so completely the plastic conditions of wet clay or retained its forms so completely after firing…[they] used its wet and ductile nature for fundamental geometric modelling and cut the material, when half-dry, into smooth planes with sharp edges of an unmatched brilliance and suggestiveness of form.<ref>Kubler, 164</ref></blockquote>\\n\\nThe Maya [[Naj Tunich]] cave tombs and other sites contain paintings, carved stelae, and grave goods in pottery, [[jade]] and metal, including [[death mask]]s. In dry areas, many ancient textiles have been found in graves from South America\\'s [[Paracas culture]], which wrapped its mummies tightly in several layers of elaborately patterned cloth.

An exception in the Classical World were the [[Lycia]]ns of [[Anatolia]].

See [[Cremation in the Christian World]] for more details—the [[Orthodox church]]s still forbid cremation.</ref> Although mass [[ossuaries]] have also been used, burial has always been the preferred Christian tradition, at least until recent times. Burial was, for as long as there was room, usually in a graveyard adjacent to the church, with a gravestone or horizontal slab, or for the wealthy or important clergy, inside it. Wall tombs in churches strictly include the body itself, often in a sarcophagus, while often the body is buried in a [[crypt]] or under the church floor, with a monument on the wall. Persons of importance, especially monarchs, might be buried in a free-standing sarcophagus, perhaps surrounded by an elaborate enclosure using metalwork and sculpture; grandest of all were the [[shrine]]s of saints, which became the destinations of [[pilgrimage]]s. The monument to [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]] in the [[Hofkirche, Innsbruck]] took decades to complete,<ref>Board of Trustees for The Hofkirche in Innsbruck.</ref> while the [[Arca di San Domenico|tomb of Saint Dominic]] in [[Bologna]] took several centuries to reach its final form.<ref>Welch, 26</ref>\\n\\nIf only because its strong prejudice against free-standing and life-size sculpture, [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] could not have developed the tomb monument in the same way as the Western Church, and the burials of rich or important individuals continued the classical tradition of sarcophagi carved in relief, with the richness of the carving tending to diminish over the centuries, until just simple religious symbols were left.  [[Constantine I]] and most later [[Byzantine Emperor]]s up to 1028 were buried in the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] in Constantinople, which was destroyed after the [[fall of Constantinople]] of 1453.  Some massive but mostly plain [[porphyry]] sarcophagi from the church are now placed outside the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]].<ref>Downey.</ref>\\n\\nThe [[Tomb of Antipope John XXIII]] in [[Florence]] is a grand [[Early Renaissance]] wall tomb by [[Donatello]] and [[Michelozzo]]; although classical in style, it reflects the somewhat inharmonious stacking up of different elements typical of major Gothic tombs.  It has a life-size effigy lying on the sarcophagus, which was common from the Romanesque period through to the [[Baroque]] and beyond.<ref>Levey 1967, 57–59</ref>  Ruling dynasties were often buried together, usually in monasteries; the [[Chartreuse de Champmol]] was founded for that purpose by the [[House of Valois|Valois]] [[Duke of Burgundy|Dukes of Burgundy]] in 1383.  The [[Scaliger tombs]] in [[Verona]] are magnificent free-standing [[Gothic art|Gothic]] canopied tombs—they are outside the church in a special enclosure, and so are unrestricted in height.<ref>Though they are exceeded in scale by [[Gothic revival]] monuments like the [[Albert Memorial]] and the [[Scott Monument]], neither containing a tomb.</ref> Important churches like Saint Peter\\'s in Rome, [[Saint Paul\\'s Cathedral, London]], [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice]] (twenty-five [[Doge]]s), and the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence]] contain large numbers of impressive monuments to the great and the good, created by the finest architects and sculptors available.  Local [[parish church]]es are also often full of monuments, which may include large and artistically significant ones for local landowners and notables.  Often a prominent family would add a special chapel for their use, including their tombs; in Catholic countries, bequests would pay for [[Catholic mass|masses]] to be said in perpetuity for their souls.  By the [[High Renaissance]], led by [[Michelangelo]]\\'s tombs, the effigies are often sitting up, and later may stand.  Often they turn towards the altar, or are kneeling facing it in profile.<ref>Hall, 325</ref>\\n[[Image:MULO-Philippe Gueldre Death Mirror.jpg|thumb|left|\"The Mirror of Death\": Detail from a French [[Renaissance]] monument of 1547|alt=Close-up of a rectangular-shaped carving in stone.

Kings might be buried with a [[sceptre]], and bishops with a [[crozier]], their respective symbols of office.<ref>Piponnier & Mane, 112–113</ref>  The 7th century [[Stonyhurst Gospel]], with a unique [[Insular art|Insular]] original leather binding, was recovered from [[St Cuthbert\\'s coffin]], itself a significant object; it was probably Cuthbert\\'s personal copy, which he had very likely scribed himself.<ref>Bloxham, Jim & Rose, Krisine; [http://www.gbwny.org/news/2007/11/st-cuthbert-gospel-of-st-john-formerly-known-as-the-stonyhurst-gospel/ \\'\\'St. Cuthbert Gospel of St. John, Formerly Known as the Stonyhurst Gospel\\'\\']</ref>  The armour and sword of a knight might be hung over his tomb, as those of [[Edward, the Black Prince|the Black Prince]] still are in [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. The Early Christian Church, to the frustration of historians of costume, encouraged burial in a plain white [[winding-sheet]], as being all that would be required at the Second Coming.  For centuries, most except royalty followed this custom, which at least kept clothing, which was very expensive for rich and poor alike, available for the use of the living.  The use of a rich cloth [[Pall (funeral)|pall]] to cover the coffin during the funeral grew during the Middle Ages; initially these were brightly coloured and patterned, only later black.  They were usually then given to the Church to use for [[vestment]]s or other decorations.<ref>Piponnier & Mane, 34–35; 112–113</ref>   \\n\\nFrom the early 13th century to the 16th, a popular form of monument north of the Alps, especially for the smaller landowner and merchant classes, was the [[monumental brass]], a sheet of brass on which the image of the person or persons commemorated was engraved, often with inscriptions and an architectural surround.  They could be on the floor or wall inside a church. These provide valuable evidence as to changes in costume, especially for women.  Many bishops and even some German rulers were commemorated with brasses.<ref>\"Brasses, Monumental\"</ref>\\n \\n[[File:Pompe funebre for Katarzyna Opalińska.jpg|thumb|\\'\\'[[Castrum doloris]]\\'\\' for a Queen of Poland, erected in [[Notre Dame de Paris]] in 1747]]\\nThe \\'\\'[[castrum doloris]]\\'\\' was a temporary [[catafalque]] erected around the coffin for the [[lying in state]] of important people, usually in a church, the funerary version of the elaborate temporary decorations for other court festivities, like [[royal entries]].  These began in the late Middle Ages, but reached their height of elaboration in the 18th century.<ref>The corpse was in fact not always present. Bagliani, 158–159</ref> A particular feature in Poland was the [[coffin portrait]], a bust-length painted portrait of the deceased, attached to the coffin, but removed before burial and often then hung in the church.  Elsewhere, death masks were used in similar fashion.  [[Hatchment]]s were a special lozenge-shaped painted [[coat of arms]] which was displayed on the house of the deceased for a mourning period, before usually being moved to hang in the church.  Like [[mourning|mourning clothes]], these fall outside a strict definition of art.<ref>Piponnier & Mane, 113 for the origins of mourning clothes.</ref>\\n\\nFor some time after the [[Protestant Reformation]], [[English church monuments]] formed the majority of large-scale artworks added to Protestant churches, especially in sculpture.  The English upper classes ceased to commission altarpieces and other religious art for churches, but their tomb monuments continued to grow in size to fill the empty wall spaces; similar trends were seen in [[Lutheran]] countries, but [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] tended to be more disapproving of figure sculpture.<ref>See for example Michalski, xi. Here Michalski refers to this rejection of religious imagery within Calvinism as \"iconophobia\". See also Gäbler, 72,76–77 and Potter, 130–131 regarding the religious disputations in Zürich (1523) concerning (among other things) the removal of statues of saints and other icons.

The cemeteries of the large Italian cities are generally accepted to have outdone those of other nations in terms of extravagant statuary, especially the [[Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno]] in [[Genoa]], the [[Cimitero Monumentale di Milano]] and the [[Certosa di Bologna]].<ref>Berresford, throughout, and Prefaces</ref>  In Italy at least, funerary sculpture remained of equal status to other types during the 19th and early 20th centuries, and was made by the leading artists, often receiving reviews in the press, and being exhibited, perhaps in [[maquette]] form.<ref>Berresford, 13, and 58 on exhibitions</ref>  Monuments kept up with contemporary stylistic developments during the 19th century, embracing [[Symbolism]] enthusiatically, but then gradually became detached from the [[avant-garde]] after [[Art Nouveau]] and a few [[Art Deco]] examples.<ref>Berresford, 77–78 on \"Liberty\" (Italian term for \"Art Nouveau\") and 99–104 on Art Deco.</ref>  Where burials in church crypts or floors took place, memorial [[stained glass]] windows, mostly on normal religious subjects but with a commemorative panel, are often found.  [[War memorial]]s, other than on the site of a battle, were relatively unusual until the 19th century, but became increasingly common during it, and after [[World War I]] were erected even in villages of the main combatant nations.<ref>Mosse, Chapter 5</ref>\\n\\n=== Islam ===\\nIslamic funerary art is dominated by [[architecture]].  Grave goods are discouraged to the point that their absence is frequently one recognition criterion of Muslim burials.<ref>Insoll, 172</ref> Royalty and important religious figures were typically buried in plain stone sarcophagi, perhaps with a religious inscription.  However, funerary architecture often offered a means of \"moving beyond the strictures of formal Muslim burial rites\" and expressing social dimensions such as status, piety, love for the deceased, and Muslim identity.<ref>Insoll, 177–180</ref> A number of distinct architectural traditions arose for expressing these social elements.  The Islamic tradition was slow in starting; the \\'\\'[[hadith]]\\'\\' \"condemn the building of tombs, and [[Muhammed]] himself set the example of requesting burial in an unmarked grave in one of the chambers of his house\" in [[Medina]],<ref>Ruggles, 103</ref> though by at least the 12th century, buildings of the vast [[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi]] complex already marked the site.  The earliest identified Muslim monumental tomb, in [[Samarra]] in Iraq, only dates from 862, and was commissioned by the Byzantine princess whose son was buried there.<ref>Ruggles, 103–104</ref>  At some point, the tradition incorporated the idea of a garden setting, perhaps following the Islamic concept of [[Paradise]], an association certainly made when the tradition was mature, although the difficulty of reconstructing gardens from archaeology makes the early stages of this process hard to trace.  At any rate, gardens surrounding tombs became established in Islamic tradition in many parts of the world, and existing pleasure gardens were sometimes appropriated for this purpose.  Versions of the formal Persian \\'\\'[[charbagh]]\\'\\' design were widely used in India, Persia and elsewhere.<ref>Ruggles, Chapter 9</ref>    \\n\\n{{multiple image\\n|align = centre\\n|direction = horizontal\\n|header = \\n|header_align = centre\\n|header_background = \\n|footer = \\n|footer_align = \\n|footer_background = \\n|width = \\n|image1 = Bukhara - Samanid Mausoleum.jpg\\n|width1 = 170\\n|alt1 = \\n|caption1 = Brick [[Samanid Mausoleum]], c. 910, [[Bokhara]]\\n|\\n|image2 = Humayun\\'s Tomb.jpg \\n|width2 = 210\\n|alt2 =\\n|caption2 = [[Humayun\\'s Tomb]] (1560s), [[Dehli]], in its garden setting\\n|\\n|image3 = DSC04799 Istanbul - Cimitero di Eyüp - Foto G.

These single-chambered tombs developed into larger buildings in the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Empires,<ref name=\"Insoll, 177\">Insoll, 177</ref> like the [[Gur-e Amir]] tomb of [[Timur]] at [[Samarkand]] and the famous Mughal tombs of India, which culminated in the [[Taj Mahal]]. The Mughal tombs are mostly set in a large walled \\'\\'charbagh\\'\\' (\\'\\'chahar-bagh\\'\\') or [[Mughal gardens]], often with [[Pavilion (structure)|pavilion]]s at the corners<ref name=\"Insoll, 177\"/> and a gatehouse. The Taj Mahal is atypically placed at the end of the garden, backing onto the river [[Yamuna]]; a central placing is usual.<ref>Ruggles, 112 and 122. Her Chapter 10 includes a detailed description of the Taj with special reference to its gardens.</ref>  They may have [[minaret]]s, although they do not normally function as [[mosque]]s.  The [[Tomb of Jahangir]] lacks any dome,<ref>An interesting contrast with the Taj Mahal, given they were both built by [[Shah Jahan]].</ref> while the [[Tomb of Akbar the Great]] has only small decorative ones.  Other Islamic Indian rulers built similar tombs, of which the [[Gol Gumbaz]] is perhaps the most remarkable.\\n\\nIn all this tradition, the contemporary architectural style for mosques was adapted for a building with a smaller main room, and usually no courtyard.  Decoration was often tilework, and could include \\'\\'[[pietre dure|parchin kari]]\\'\\' inlays in semi-precious stone, painting, and decorative carving.  The sarcophagus might be in a small inner chamber, dimly visible through a grille of metal or stone, or might stand in the main room.  Money would be bequeathed to pay for continuous readings of the [[Qur\\'an]] in the mausoleum, and they were normally open for visitors to pay their respects. The [[Mausoleum of Khomeini]], still under construction in a [[Tehran]] cemetery, and intended to be the centre of a huge complex, continues these traditions.<ref name=\"NYT K\">The New York Times, [http://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/08/world/khomeini-s-tomb-attracts-pilgrims.html \\'\\'Khomeini\\'s Tomb Attracts Pilgrims\\'\\'], Philip Shenon, Published: July 8, 1990, accessed April 25, 2010.</ref>  \\n\\nThe tradition evolved differently in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] world, where smaller single-roomed \\'\\'[[türbe]]\\'\\' typically stand on the grounds of mosque complexes, often built by the deceased.  The sarcophagi (often purely symbolic, as the body is below the floor) may be draped in a rich pall, and surmounted by a real cloth or stone [[turban]], which is also traditional at the top of ordinary [[Turkish people|Turkish]] gravestones (usually in stylised form). Two of the most famous are in the [[Süleymaniye Mosque]] in [[Istanbul]]; the [[Yeşil Türbe]] (\"Green Tomb\") of 1421 is an unusually large example in [[Bursa]], and also unusual in having extensive tile work on the exterior, which is usually masonry, whereas the interiors are often decorated with brightly-colored tiles.<ref>Levey 1975, 29–33 on Bursa, 83–84 on Istanbul; all the leading Ottoman tombs are covered in the book.</ref>\\n\\nOther parts of the Islamic world reflected local techniques and traditions.  The 15th century royal [[Tomb of Askia]] in [[Mali]] used the local technique of mud-building to erect a 17 metre high pyramidal tomb set in a mosque complex.<ref>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1139 Tomb of Askia], [[UNESCO]] page with aerial view.</ref>  At the other end of the Islamic world, [[Java]]nese royalty are mostly buried in royal graveyards such as those at [[Kota Gede]] and [[Imogiri]]. \\n\\nIn the Arab world, mausoleums of rulers are more likely to be a side-room inside a mosque or form part of a larger complex containing perhaps a hospital, \\'\\'[[madrasa]]\\'\\' or library. Large domes, elaborately decorated inside, are common.  The tomb-mosque of Sultan [[Qaitbay]] (died 1496) is a famous example, one of many in [[Cairo]], though here the tomb chamber is unusually large compared to the whole.<ref>See Fletcher & Cruickshank, 596. The [[madrassa]] is labeled \"the ultimate achievement of architectural development in Cairo\" and its tomb chamber described as \"immense.\"</ref>\\n\\n==Modern period==\\n[[Image:Rachel whitereadwien holocaust mahnmal wien judenplatz.jpg|thumb|The [[Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial]] to the 65,000 Austrian Jews killed in the [[Holocaust]], designed by [[Rachel Whiteread]] and completed in 2000.]]\\nFunerary art tends to be conservative in style, and many grave markers in various cultures follow rather traditional patterns, while others reflect [[modernism]] or other recent styles.  Public monuments to the dead continue to be erected, especially [[war memorials]].

On [[August 16]], [[Poland|Polish]] forces commanded by [[Józef Piłsudski]] [[counter-attack]]ed from the south, forcing the [[Russia]]n forces into a disorganised [[withdrawal (military)|withdrawal]] eastward and behind the [[Niemen River]].

At first, [[Józef Piłsudski]] wanted to base his operation on the [[Western Bug|Bug River]] and [[Brest-Litovsk]], but their unexpected fall made it impossible.<ref name=\"Lawrynowicz\"/> On the night of August 5—6, Piłsudski conceived a revised plan at the [[Belweder|Belweder Palace]] in Warsaw. It called in the first phase for Polish forces to withdraw across the Vistula River and defend the bridgeheads at [[Warsaw]] and at the [[Wieprz River]]. Some 25% of the available [[division (military)|divisions]] would be concentrated to the south for a strategic counteroffensive. Next, Piłsudski\\'s plan called for the 1st and 2nd Armies of Gen. [[Józef Haller de Hallenburg|Józef Haller\\'s]] Central Front (10 1/2 divisions) to take a passive role, facing the Soviet frontal attack on Warsaw from the east and holding their [[trench|entrenched]] positions at all costs. At the same time, the 5th Army (5 1/2 divisions) under Gen. [[Władysław Sikorski]], subordinate to Gen. Haller, would defend the northern area near the [[Modlin Fortress]] and, when it became feasible, strike from behind Warsaw, thus cutting off Soviet forces attempting to envelop Warsaw from that direction, and break through the enemy front and fall upon the rear of the Soviet Northwestern Front. An additional five divisions of the 5th Army were to defend Warsaw from the north. General [[Franciszek Latinik]]\\'s 1st Army would defend Warsaw itself, while General [[Bolesław Roja]]\\'s 2nd Army was to hold the Vistula River line from [[Góra Kalwaria]] to [[Dęblin]].<ref name=\"Lawrynowicz\"/><ref name=\"Szczep\"/>\\n\\nThe most important role, however, was assigned to a relatively small (some 20,000-man), newly assembled \"Reserve Army\" (also called the \"Assault Group\" - \\'\\'Grupa Uderzeniowa\\'\\'), commanded personally by Józef Piłsudski, comprising the most battle-hardened and determined Polish units drawn from the southern front. They were to be reinforced by General [[Leonard Skierski]]\\'s 4th Army and General [[Zygmunt Zieliński]]\\'s 3rd Army, which, after retreating from the [[Western Bug River]] area, had moved not directly toward Warsaw but had crossed the [[Wieprz River]] and broken off contact with their pursuers. The Assault Group\\'s assignment was to spearhead a lightning northern offensive from the Vistula-Wieprz River triangle south of Warsaw, through a weak spot identified by Polish intelligence between the Soviet Western and Southwestern Fronts. This would separate the Soviet Western Front from its reserves and disorganize its movements. Eventually the gap between Gen. Sikorski\\'s 5th Army and the advancing Assault Group would close near the East Prussian border, leaving the Soviet offensive \"trapped in a sack.\"<ref name=\"Szczep\"/>\\n\\nAlthough based on fairly reliable information provided by Polish intelligence and intercepted Soviet [[radio]] communications<ref name=\"Ścieżyński\">{{pl icon}} [[Mieczysław Ścieżyński|Ścieżyński, Mieczysław]], [[Colonel of the (Polish) General Staff]], \\'\\'Radjotelegrafja jako źrodło wiadomości o nieprzyjacielu\\'\\' (Radiotelegraphy as a Source of Intelligence on the Enemy), Przemyśl, [[Printing and Binding Establishment of (Military) Corps District No. X HQ]], 1928, 49 pp.</ref><ref name=\"Wroński\">{{pl icon}} [[Paweł Wroński]], \\'\\'\"Sensacyjne odkrycie: Nie było cudu nad Wisłą\"\\'\\' (\"A Remarkable Discovery: There Was No Miracle at the Vistula\"), \\'\\'[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]\\'\\', [http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,53600,2855976.html online].</ref><ref name=\"Bury\">[[Jan Bury]], POLISH CODEBREAKING DURING THE RUSSO-POLISH WAR OF 1919-1920, [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3926/is_200407/ai_n9458625 online]</ref>, the plan was labelled as \\'amateurish\\' by many high-ranking army officers and military experts, who were quick to point out Piłsudski\\'s lack of formal military education. Many Polish units, a mere week before the planned date of the counter-attack, were fighting in places as far as 100-150 miles (150 to 250 km) from the concentration points. All of the troop movements were within striking distance of the Red Army. One strong push by the Red Army could derail plans for a Polish counter-attack and endanger the cohesion of the whole Polish front.

Even Piłsudski himself admitted in his memoirs that it was a very risky gamble and the reasons he decided to go forward with the plan were the defeatist mood of politicians, fear for the safety of the capital and the prevailing feeling that if Warsaw were to fall, all would be lost. Only the desperate situation persuaded other army commanders to go along with it, as they realized that under such circumstances it was the only possible way to avoid a devastating defeat. Ironically, when a copy of the plan accidentally fell into Soviet hands it was considered to be a poor deception attempt and ignored.<ref name=\"Szczep\"/> A few days later, the Soviets paid dearly for this mistake.\\n[[Image:Tukhachevsky-mikhail-2.jpg|thumb|right|100|Soviet commander: Mikhail Tukhachevski.]]\\n\\nThere is some controversy as to the authorship of the plan.<ref name=\"Szczep\"/> Due to Piłsudski\\'s political image, he was largely unpopular with the right wing of Polish politics. Because of that, after the battle many journalists suggested that the plan was in fact prepared either by [[Maxime Weygand]] or by the Polish Chief of Staff [[Tadeusz Rozwadowski]].<ref name=\"Szczep\"/> According to recent research<ref name=\"Odziemkowski\">{{pl icon}} {{cite journal | author=[[Janusz Odziemkowski]] | title=\"Wojna Polski z Rosją Sowiecką, 1919-1920\" (\"Poland\\'s War with Soviet Russia, 1919-1920\") | journal=Mówią Wieki (The Ages Speak) | year=2005 | volume=2/2005 | pages=46&ndash;58 }}</ref>, the [[French Military Mission to Poland]] proposed only a minor tactical counter-attack of two divisions towards [[Mińsk Mazowiecki]].

On the other hand, Gen. Rozwadowski\\'s plan called for a deeper thrust into Russian lines from the area of Wieprz.

With his 24 divisions, he planned to repeat the classic maneuvre of [[Ivan Paskievich]], who in 1831, during the [[November Uprising]], had crossed the [[Vistula]] at [[Toruń]] and reached Warsaw practically unopposed<ref name=\"Erickson\">{{en icon}} {{cite book | author = | coauthors = | title =The Soviet High Command: a military-political history 1918-1941 | year =2001 | editor = | pages =84-90 | chapter =Before the Gates of Warsaw: 1920 | chapterurl =http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0714651788&id=rgkSxFpKmIsC&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&vq=Warsaw&dq=Warsaw+1920&sig=3ZjTdO849Z5fH4tcyC0Pi7nFP9M | publisher =Frank Cass | location = | id =ISBN 0-7146-5178-8 | url = }}</ref><ref name=\"Lawrynowicz\"/>. This move would also cut the Polish forces off from [[Gdańsk]], the only port open to shipments of arms and supplies.<ref name=\"Szczep\"/>\\n\\nThe main weakness of the Soviet plan was the poorly defended southern flank, secured only by the [[Pinsk Marshes]] and the weak [[Mozyr Group]]; the majority of the Soviet Southwest Front was engaged in the [[battle of Lwów (1920)]].<ref name=\"Lawrynowicz\"/>\\n\\n===First phase, August 12===\\nMeanwhile Bolsheviks pushed forward. [[Gay Dimitrievich Gay]]\\'s Cavalry Corps together with the 4th Army crossed [[Wkra]] river and advanced towards the town of [[Włocławek]]. The 15th and 3rd Armies were approaching [[Modlin fortress]] and the 16th Army moved towards Warsaw.\\n\\nThe final Soviet assault on Warsaw began on August 12 with the Soviet 16th Army [[Battle of Radzymin (1920)|the attack at the town of Radzymin]] (only 23 kilometres east of the city). Its initial success prompted Piłsudski to move up his plans by 24 hours.\\n[[Image:Battle of Warsaw - Phase 1.png|thumb|200px|left|Positions prior to the battle.]]\\n\\nThe first phase of the battle started on [[August 13]], with a [[Red Army]] frontal assault on the [[Praga]] [[bridgehead]]. In heavy fighting, [[Radzymin]] changed hands several times and foreign [[diplomat]]s, with the exception of British and [[Holy See|Vatican]] ambassadors, hastily left Warsaw.<ref name=\"Lawrynowicz\"/> On [[August 14]], it fell to the [[Red Army]], and the lines of Gen. [[Władysław Sikorski]]\\'s Polish 5th Army were broken. The 5th Army had to fight three Soviet armies at once: the 3rd, 4th and 15th. The [[Modlin (village)|Modlin]] sector was reinforced with reserves (the \\'\\'[[Siberian Brigade]],\\'\\' and Gen. [[Franciszek Krajowski]]\\'s fresh \\'\\'18th Infantry Division\\'\\'—both elite, battle-tested units), and the 5th Army held out until dawn.\\n\\nThe situation was saved around midnight when the \\'\\'203rd [[Uhlan]] Regiment\\'\\' managed to break through the Bolshevik lines and destroy the [[radio station]] of [[A.D. Shuvayev]]\\'s Soviet 4th Army. The latter unit had only one remaining radio station fixed on one frequency which was known to the Polish intelligence. Since the Polish code-breakers did not want the Bolsheviks to find out that their codes were broken, but still neutralize the other radio station, the radio station in Warsaw recited the book of [[Genesis]] in Polish and Latin on the frequency used by the 4th Army, which thus lost contact with its [[headquarters]] and continued marching toward [[Toruń]] and [[Płock]], unaware of [[Mikhail Tukhachevski|Tukhachevski\\'s]] order to turn south. The raid by the 203rd Uhlans is sometimes referred to as \\'\\'the Miracle of [[Ciechanów]]\\'\\'.<ref name=\"Szczep\"/>\\n\\nAt the same time, the Polish 1st Army under Gen. [[Franciszek Latinik]] resisted a Red Army direct assault on Warsaw by six [[rifle]] divisions. The struggle for control of Radzymin forced Gen. Józef Haller, commander of the Polish \\'\\'Northern Front\\'\\', to start the 5th Army\\'s counterattack earlier than planned.<ref name=\"Lawrynowicz\"/>\\n\\nDuring this time, Piłsudski was finishing his plans for the counter-offensive. He decided to personally supervise the attack and, because of the enormous risks involved, he handed in a letter with his resignation from all state functions. Thereafter, between August 13 and 15, he visited all units of the 4th Army concentrating near [[Puławy]], about 100 kilometres south of Warsaw. He tried to raise morale, since many soldiers were tired and demoralized and numerous recently incorporated replacements showed everyone the extent of Polish losses. Logistics were a nightmare, as the Polish army was equipped with guns made in five countries and rifles manufactured in six, each of them using different ammunition. Adding to the problem was the fact that the equipment was in poor shape. Piłsudski remembers: \"In 21 Division, almost half of the soldiers paraded in front of me barefoot.\" Nevertheless, in only three days, Piłsudski was able to raise the morale of his troops and motivate them for one of their greatest efforts.<ref name=\"Lawrynowicz\"/>\\n\\n===Second phase, August 14===\\nThe 27th Infantry Division of the Red Army managed to reach the village of [[Izabelin]], 13 kilometres from the capital, but this was the closest that Russian forces would come. Soon the tides of battle would change.<ref name=\"Lawrynowicz\"/>\\n[[Image:Bitwa warszawska rano 15 lipca 600px.png|thumb|200px|right|Positions around Warsaw, early morning on [[August 15]].]]\\n\\nTukhachevski, certain that all was going according to plan, was actually falling into Piłsudski\\'s trap. The Russian march across the Vistula in the north was striking into an operational vacuum, where there was no sizeable group of Polish troops. On the other hand, south of Warsaw, Tukhachevski left only token forces to guard the vital link between the North-Western and South-Western Fronts. The [[Mozyr]] Group, which was assigned this task, numbered only 8,000 soldiers. Another error neutralized the 1st Cavalry Army of [[Semyon Budyonny]], a unit much feared by Piłsudski and other Polish commanders. Soviet High Command, at Tukhachevski\\'s insistence, ordered the 1st Cavalry Army to march toward Warsaw from the south. Semyon Budyonny did not obey this order due to a grudge between commanding South-Western Front generals [[Aleksandr Yegorov]] and Tukhachevski.<ref name=\"Lawrynowicz\"/> In addition, the political games of [[Joseph Stalin]] at the time the chief political [[commissar]] of the South-Western Front, further contributed to Yegorov\\'s and Budyonny\\'s disobedience.<ref name=\" Adam Bruno Ulam\">\\'\\'Stalin: The Man and His Era\\'\\', Beacon Press, 1987, ISBN 0-8070-7005-X, [http://books.google.com/books?id=A1eYKftgwgYC&pg=PA188&lpg=PA188&sig=_e0xasWyvPEw8iaZgY9EL8v_6yg Google Print, p.189]</ref> Stalin, in search of personal glory, wanted to capture the besieged important industrial center of [[Lwów]].

It faced the combined forces of the Soviet 3rd and 15th Armies (both numerically and technically superior). The struggle at [[Nasielsk]] lasted until [[August 15]] and resulted in the almost complete destruction of the town. However, the Soviet advance toward Warsaw and Modlin was halted at the end of August 15th and on that day Polish forces recaptured Radzymin, which boosted the Polish morale.<ref name=\"PWN:wojna\">{{pl icon}} [http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo.php?id=3997498 Wojna polsko-bolszewicka]. Entry at [[Internetowa encyklopedia PWN]]. Last accessed on 27 October 2006.</ref>\\n\\nFrom that moment on, Gen. Sikorski\\'s 5th Army pushed exhausted Soviet units away from Warsaw, in an almost [[blitzkrieg]]-like operation. Sikorski\\'s units, supported by the majority of the small number of Polish [[tank]]s, [[armoured car]]s and [[artillery]] of the two [[armoured train]]s, advanced at the speed of 30 kilometres a day, soon destroying any Soviet hopes for completing their \"enveloping\" manoeuvre in the north.<ref name=\"Szczep\"/>\\n\\n===Third phase, August 16===\\nOn [[August 16]], the Polish \\'\\'Reserve Army\\'\\' commanded by Józef Piłsudski began its march north from the [[Wieprz]] River. It faced the \\'\\'[[Mozyr]] Group\\'\\', a Soviet corps that had defeated the Poles during the [[Kyiv]] operation several months earlier. However, during its pursuit of the retreating Polish armies, the \\'\\'Mozyr Group\\'\\' had lost most of its forces and been reduced to a mere two divisions covering a 150-kilometre front-line on the left flank of the Soviet 16th Army. On the first day of the counter-offensive, only one of the five Polish divisions reported any sort of opposition, while the remaining four, supported by a [[cavalry]] brigade, managed to push north 45 kilometres unopposed. When evening fell, the town of [[Włodawa]] had been liberated, and the communication and supply lines of the Soviet 16th Army had been cut. Even Piłsudski was surprised by the extent of these early successes. \\'\\'Reserve Army\\'\\' units covered about 70 kilometres in 36 hours, splitting the Soviet offensive and meeting virtually no resistance. The Mozyr Group consisted solely of the 57th Infantry Division, which had been beaten in the first day of the operation. Consequently, the Polish armies found a huge gap between the Russian fronts and exploited it, continuing their northward offensive with two armies following and falling on the surprised and confused enemy.<ref name=\"Lawrynowicz\"/><ref name=\"PWN:wojna\"/><ref name=\"Szczep\"/>\\n\\nOn August 18, [[Mikhail Tukhachevski]], in his headquarters in [[Minsk]] some 300 miles east of Warsaw, became fully aware of the extent of his defeat and ordered the remnants of his forces to retreat and regroup. His intention was to straighten the front line, stop the Polish attack and to regain the initiative, but the orders either arrived too late or failed to arrive at all. Soviet General [[Gay Dimitrievich Gay|Gay\\'s]] 3rd Cavalry Corps continued to advance toward [[Pomerania]], its lines endangered by the Polish 5th Army, which had finally managed to push back the Bolshevik armies and gone over in pursuit. The Polish 1st Division of the Legion, in order to cut the enemy\\'s retreat, made a remarkable march from [[Lubartów]] to [[Białystok]] - 163 miles in 6 days. The soldiers fought in two battles, slept only a few hours and marched for up to 21 hours a day. Their sacrifice and endurance was rewarded when the entire 16th Soviet Army was cut off at [[Białystok]] and most of its troops taken prisoner.<ref name=\"Lawrynowicz\"/>\\n\\nThe Soviet armies in the centre of the front fell into chaos. Some divisions continued to fight their way toward [[Warsaw]], while others turned to retreat, lost their cohesion and panicked<ref name=\"Cisek\">{{en icon}} {{cite book | author =Janusz Cisek | coauthors = | title =Kosciuszko, We Are Here!: American Pilots of the Kosciuszko Squadron in Defense of Poland, 1919-1921 | year = | editor = | pages =141 | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =McFarland & Company | location = | id =ISBN 0-7864-1240-2 | url =http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0786412402&id=hNuGZOGk6UoC&pg=PA141&lpg=PA141&vq=panic&dq=Warsaw+1920&sig=G1_4J74xbPKYN6Qsd7YgIVM2UWY | format = | accessdate = }}</ref>. The Russian [[commander-in-chief]] lost contact with most of his forces, and all Soviet plans were thrown into disorder. Only the 15th Army remained an organised force and tried to obey Tukhachevski\\'s orders, shielding the withdrawal of the westernmost extended 4th Army. But it was defeated twice on August 19th and 20th and joined the general rout of the Red Army\\'s North-Western Front. Tukhachevski had no choice but to order a full [[retreat]] toward the Western [[Bug River]]. By August 21st, all organized resistance ceased to exist and by August 31, the Soviet South-Western Front was completely routed.<ref name=\"Lawrynowicz\"/><ref name=\"PWN:wojna\"/>\\n\\n===Aftermath===\\nAlthough Poland managed to achieve victory and push back the Russians, Piłsudski\\'s plan to outmanoeuvre and surround the Red Army did not succeed completely. Four Soviet armies began to march toward Warsaw on July 4th in the framework of the North-Western Front. By the end of August, the 4th and 15th Armies were defeated in the field, their remnants crossed the Prussian border and were disarmed. Nevertheless, these troops were soon released and fought against Poland again. The 3rd Army retreated east so quickly that Polish troops could not catch up with them; consequently, this army sustained the fewest losses. The 16th Army disintegrated at [[Białystok]] and most of its soldiers became prisoners of war. The majority of Gay\\'s 3rd Cavalry Corps were forced across the German border and were temporarly interned in [[East Prussia]].<ref name=\"Lawrynowicz\"/>\\n[[Image:Polish-soviet_war_1920_Aftermath_of_Battle_of_Warsaw.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Polish soldiers displaying captured Soviet battle standards.]]\\n\\nSoviet losses were about 10,000 dead, 500 missing, 10,000 wounded and 65,000 captured, compared to Polish losses of approximately 4,500 killed, 22,000 wounded and 10,000 missing. Between 25,000 and 30,000 Soviet troops managed to reach the borders of [[Germany]]. After crossing into East Prussia, they were briefly [[internment|interned]], then allowed to leave with their arms and equipment. Poland captured about 231 [[artillery]] guns and 1,023 [[machine-gun]]s.<ref name=\"Lawrynowicz\"/>\\n\\nThe southern arm of the [[Red Army]]\\'s forces had been routed and no longer posed a threat to the Poles. Semyon Budyonny\\'s 1st Cavalry Army besieging [[Lwów]] had been defeated at the [[Battle of Komarów]] (August 31, 1920) and the [[Battle of Hrubieszów]]. By mid-October, the Polish Army had reached the [[Tarnopol]]-[[Dubno]]-[[Minsk]]-[[Drisa]] line.\\n\\nTukhachevski managed to reorganize the eastward-retreating forces and in September established a new defensive line near [[Grodno]]. In order to break it, the Polish Army had to fight the [[Battle of the Niemen River]] (September 15-September 21), once again defeating the Bolshevik armies. After the [[Battle of the Szczara River]], both sides were exhausted and on [[October 12]], under heavy pressure from [[France]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]], a [[cease-fire]] was signed. By [[October 18]], the fighting was over, and on [[March 18]], 1921, the [[Treaty of Riga]] was signed, ending hostilities.\\n\\nSoviet [[propaganda]] before the Battle of Warsaw had described the fall of Poland\\'s capital as imminent, and the anticipated fall of Warsaw was to be a signal for the start of a large-scale communist revolutions in Poland, Germany and other European countries, economically devastated by the [[World War I|First World War]]. The Soviet defeat was thus a setback for some Soviet officials (particularly [[Vladimir Lenin]]).\\n\\nA [[National Democratic Party (Poland)|National Democrat]] [[Sejm]] deputy, [[Stanisław Stroński]], coined the phrase, \"Miracle at the Wisła\" ([[Polish language|Polish]]: \\'\\'\"Cud nad Wisłą\"\\'\\'), to underline his disapproval of [[Józef Piłsudski|Piłsudski\\'s]] \"Ukrainian adventure.\" Stroński\\'s phrase was adopted with approval by some patriotically- or piously-minded Poles unaware of Stroński\\'s ironic intent.<ref name=\"Szczep\"/>\\n\\n===Breaking of Soviet ciphers===\\nAccording to documents found in 2005 at Poland\\'s Central Military Archives, [[Biuro Szyfrów|Polish cryptologists]] broke intercepted Russian ciphers as early as September 1919. At least some of the Polish victories, not only the Battle of Warsaw but throughout the campaign, are attributable to this.

These included: \\n* Emphasis on renunciation and having complete trust in God.\\n* The unity of mankind and shunning distinctions based on social, economic, religious status.\\n* Helping the needy, feeding the hungry and being sympathetic to the oppressed.\\n* Strong disapproval of mixing with the Sultans, the princes and the nobles.\\n* Exhortation in making close contact with the poor and the downtrodden\\n* Adopting an uncompromising attitude towards all forms of political and social oppression.\\n* A bold stance in favour of [[Sema]], which some considered unislamic. Perhaps this was with the view that this was in consonance with the role of music in some modes of Hindu worship, could serve as a basis of contact with local people and would facilitate mutual adjustments between the two communities.<ref>{{cite book\\n  | last = Faruqi\\n  | first = Zia ul Hasan\\n  | authorlink = \\n  | title = Fawa\\'id Al-Fu\\'ad--Spiritual and Literary Discourses of Shaikh Nizammuddin Awliya \\n  | publisher = South Asia Books\\n  | year = 1996\\n  | isbn = 81-246-0042-2 }}</ref> In fact [[Qawwali]], a form of devotional music, was originally created by one his most cherished disciples: Amir Khusro. \\n\\nNizamuddin did not much bother about the theoretical aspects of Sufism, believing rather that it were the practical aspects that counted, as it was anyway not possible to describe the diversified mystical experiences called spiritual states or stations which a practicing Sufi encountered. He discouraged the demonstration of [[Keramat]] and emphasized that it was obligatory for the Auliya (which roughly means the friends of God) to hide the ability of Keramat from the commoners.

After a few generations, one of his descendants called \\'Alī, known as Dāniyāl, the grandfather of Nizāmuddīn Auliyā\\', migrated to the city of Badāyūn in Uttar Pradesh, India.\\n\\n===Ancestral lineage===\\n\\n#[[Muhammad|Muḥammad]]\\n#[[Ali|\\'Alī bin Abī Ṭālib]]\\n# [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn bin \\'Alī]]\\n#[[Ali ibn Hussain|\\'Alī bin al-Husayn]] Zayn-ul\\'Ābidīn\\n#[[Muhammad al-Baqir|Muḥammad al-Bāqir]]\\n#[[Jafar al-Sadiq|Ja\\'far al-Ṣādiq]]\\n#[[Musa al-Kazim|Mūsā al-Kāḍhim]]\\n#[[Ali al-Rida|\\'Alī al-Riḍā]]\\n#[[Muhammad al-Taqi|Muḥammad al-Taqī]]\\n#[[Ali al-Naqi|\\'Alī al-Naqī]]\\n#Ja\\'far Bukhārī\\n#\\'Alī Aṣghar Bukhārī\\n#Abī \\'Abdullāh Bukhārī\\n#Aḥmad Bukhārī\\n#\\'Alī Bukhārī\\n#Husayn Bukhārī\\n#\\'Abdullāh Bukhārī\\n#\\'Alī, known as Dāniyāl\\n#Aḥmad Badāyūnī\\n# Nizāmuddīn Auliyā\\'\\n\\n==Spiritual history==\\n[[File:Nizamuddin Dargah and Jamaat Khana Masjid, Delhi.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Mughal princess [[Jahanara Begum|Jahan Ara]]\\'s tomb (left), Nizamuddin Auliya\\'s tomb (right) and [[Jama\\'at Khana]] Masjid (background), at [[Nizamuddin Dargah]] complex, in [[Nizamuddin West]], [[Delhi]]]]\\nHe was merely sixteen or seventeen years old when he first heard the name of [[Fariduddin Ganjshakar|Farīduddīn Ganjshakar]], and feelings of love and respect arose in his heart right then. He narrates to his disciples that he never felt the same after hearing or even meeting any other sufi. The love kept increasing like a burning fire. If his classmates would like to have some work out of him they used to invoke the name of Bābā Farīd, and he never refused anything asked in his name. He didn\\'t feel the same for anyone else in his entire lifetime.  He became his disciple after completing his studies at the age of 20.

His shrine is in Chirag Dilli, New Delhi, India.\\n\\n===Amīr Khusro===\\nHe was the most loved disciple of his master.

After the death of Nizamuddin Auliya, he went to the [[Deccan]], and the place where he lived became famous thereby. His shrine is in [[Khuldabad]] in Maharashtra.\\n\\n===Jalaluddin Bhandari===\\nHe is also amongst the earliest disciples of Nizamuddin Auliya. He ran the Langar khana of Nizamuddin Auliya. After the death of Nizamuddin Auliya, he went to the Deccan with Burhanuddin Gharib, and became famous by the name of Bhandari. His shrine is in Fatehabad in the Aurangabad district of Maharashtra.\\n\\n===Syed Mahmood Kashkinakar===\\nHe holds a very special position in Islamic mysticism. He is believed to be alive in the invisible world even after his death in the visible world. There are miracles in the literature of the Chisti order which are attributed to this.\\n\\n===Ajan Fakir===\\n===Syed Ahmed Badepaa===\\nHis tomb is in First Lancer (Part of Hyderabad Now).

However he had one brother named Jamaluddin. He told him, \"your descendants will be my descendants\". Jamaluddin had one son named Ibrahim. He was nurtured by Nizamuddin Auliya after Jamaluddin\\'s death. Nizamuddin Auliya sent his nephew to [[Bengal]] in Eastern [[India]] along with one of his most famous disciples (khalifa) Aqi Seraj, famously known as Aaina-e-Hind.  Ala-ul-Haq Pandwi (the master ([[Pir (Sufism)|Pir]]) of Maqdoom Ashraf Jehangir Simnani), one of the most famous [[Sufis]] of the [[Chisti order]], became his disciple and khalifa.  Ala-ul-Haq Pandwi married his sister-in-law to  Ibrahim. They had one son, who was the most famous [[Chisti]] [[Sufi]] of [[Bihar]], known as Fariduddin Tavaela Bukhsh. He was married to the daughter of Ala-ul-Haq Pandwi. He became the khalifa of Hazrat Noor Qutb-e-Aalam Padwi (the eldest son and spiritual successor of  Ala-ul-Haq Pandwi). His [[shrine]] is one of the most famous shrines in Chandpura, [[Bihar Sharif]], [[Bihar]]. Many of his descendants are very famous Sufis, namely  Moinuddin Sani,  Naseeruddin Sani,  Sultan Chisti Nizami,  Bahauddin Chisti Nizami,  Deewan Syed Shah Abdul Wahab (his shrine is in Choti Takiya, Biharsharif),  Sultan Sani, Amjad Hussain Chisti Nizami, among others. He spread Chisti Nizami order all over Northern India. Ijaza of his Silsila  (order) is present in all the existing khanqahs of Bihar. His descendants still reside in Biharsharif and can be found in many parts of the world. However, those still looking after Nizamuddin Auliya\\'s shrine in Delhi are the descendants of his sister\\'s son.\\n\\n== The Chisti Nizami order ==\\n{{main|Chishti Order}}\\n\\nNizamuddin Auliya was the founder of the Chisti Nizami order. He had hundreds of disciples (khalifa) who had Ijaza (khilafat) from him to spread the order. Many of the sufis of the Chisti Nizami order are recognised as great sufis; the following is a list of notable sufis of the Chisti Nizami order, which includes his descendants as well as his disciples:\\n\\n[[Khwaja Bande Nawaz|Muhammad Hussaini Gisudaraz Bandanawaz]], [[Gulbarga]] (near [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]]), [[Karnataka]]; Ala-ul-Haq Pandwi &  Noor Qutb-e-Alam Pandwi, [[Pandua]], [[West Bengal]]; Makhdoom [[Ashraf Jahangir Simnani]], Kachaocha, Uttar Pradesh; Faqruddin Faqr Dehlvi, [[Mehrauli]], [[New Delhi]]; [[Shah Niyaz Ahmad Barelvi]], [[Bareilly]], [[Uttar Pradesh]]; Shafruddin Ali Ahmed & Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, Chirag Dilli, [[New Delhi]]; Zainuddin Shirazi, [[Burhanpur]], [[Madhya Pradesh]];  Muhiuddin Yousuf Yahya Madani Chishti, [[Medina]]; Kaleemullah Dehlvi Chishti, [[Delhi]]; Nizamuddin Aurangabadi; Nizamuddin Hussain, and Meerza Agha Mohammad; Muhammad Sulman Taunswi, [[Pakistan]], Mohammad Meera Hussaini, Hesamuddin Mankpuri.\\n\\n===Famous Branches===\\n\\nNizamuddin Auliya was an unparalleled sufi of his time amongst all the existing sufi orders of that time.  Many of his contemporaries were doubtless very powerful spiritual leaders,  but he was the most famous of all.  In his career of approximately 70 years as a sufi he saw the reign of seven rulers of the Delhi sultanate. The kings were very loyal to him and respectful of him. When he first arrived as the Qutb of Delhi he settled down at a lonely place on the outskirts of Delhi, Ghyaspur. But he became so famous that Ghyaspur became the main hub of Delhi and so densely populated that he wanted to leave that place but did not. He was buried in the campus of his khanqah. Ghyaspur is now a central locality of [[New Delhi]], and is known after his name Nizamuddin. The area is so vast that it is divided into four parts: [[Nizamuddin Dargah]] (where his shrine is situated), Nizamuddin East, Nizamuddin West and Hazrat Nizamuddin Railway Station.\\n\\n====The branches====\\n\\nThe Chisti order branched out with Nizamuddin Auliya to form the Chisti Nizami order. A parallel branch which started with [[Alauddin Sabir Kaliyari]], another disciple of Baba Farid, was the Chisti Sabiri branch. People started adding Nizami gracefully after their name. He spiritually made many great sufis amongst his students, descendants and the sufis of the Nizami order.\\n\\nThe branches of the Chisti Nizami order are as follows:\\n\\n=====Naseeria=====\\nHis disciple [[Nasiruddin Chiragh Dehlavi|Nasiruddin Muhammad Chirag-e-Dehli]] started the \\'\\'\\'Nizamia Naseeria\\'\\'\\' branch.\\n\\n=====Hussainia=====\\nThe \\'\\'\\'Hussainia\\'\\'\\' branch is named for [[Khwaja Bande Nawaz|Muhammad Hussaini Gisudaraz Bandanawaz]]. He was the most famous and loved disciple of [[Nasiruddin Chiragh Dehlavi|Nasiruddin Muhammad Chirag-e-Dehli]]. The khanqah he established in Gulbarga, Karnataka is still in existence.\\n\\n=====Niyazia=====\\n[[Shah Niyaz Ahmad Barelvi]], in the 19th century started the \\'\\'\\'Niyazia\\'\\'\\' branch.\\n\\n=====Serajia=====\\n\\nThe \\'\\'\\'Nizamia Serajia\\'\\'\\' branch was started by Serajuddin Aqi Seraj.  This branch is also known as \\'\\'\\'Chistia Serajia\\'\\'\\'.\\n\\n=====Ashrafia=====\\n\\nThe \\'\\'\\'Chistia Ashrafia\\'\\'\\'  branch was started by [[Ashraf Jahangir Semnani]], the most famous sufi saint of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. He established a khanqah, still in existence at Kachaucha, Uttar Pradesh, India.\\n\\n=====Faridia=====\\nThe \\'\\'\\'Chistia Serajia Faridia\\'\\'\\' order was started by Fariduddin Tavaelabukhsh, a descendant of Nizamuddin Auliya and a sufi of the Serajia branch of the Chisti order. This branch is also known as \\'\\'\\'Nizamia Serajia Faridia\\'\\'\\'.\\n\\n==King\\'s disrespect leads to his own doom==\\n\\nOne of the kings of the [[Delhi sultanate]] during Nizamuddin Auliya lifetime was [[Qutb ud din Mubarak Shah|Qutb-ud-din Mubarak Shah]], the last ruler of the [[Khilji dynasty]].  Legend has it that disrespect of Nizamuddin Auliya caused the king\\'s death. Qutb-ud-din Mubarak Shah used to assemble all the leading figures and famous personalities of Delhi in his court every weekend.  Once a courtier complained to him that Nizamuudin Auliya never came to the court.  The King declared, \"Order him in my name to come to my weekend gathering, else he will be hanged.\" When Nizamuddin Auliya\\'s disciple, [[Amir Khusrau]], related this to his master, he ignored the message, and did not even answer. As the weekend approached, his disciples became concerned for his life. On the day before the weekend, Nizamuddin Auliya went to the grave of his mother and came back looking unperturbed, telling his disciples to go home and sleep as usual. The next morning, everyone was very tense and worried, but Nizamuddin Auliya remained unperturbed. Shortly, news came that there had been a rebellion in the palace, and the king had been brutally  killed.\\n\\n==Titles given to Nizamuddin Aulia==\\n\\n*Mehboob-e-elahi (Beloved of God)\\n*Sultan-ul-Mashaiq\\n*Dastageer-e-Do Jahan (Holder of Two Worlds)\\n*Jag Ujyare\\n*Qutb-e-Dehli (Tower of Dehli)\\n\\n== Urs ==\\n\\nThe Urs (death anniversary) of Nizamuddin Auliya is celebrated at the Nizamuddin Dargah on the 17th of Rabi II (Rabi-ul-Aaqir), and that of Amir Khusro on the 18th of Shawwal.\\n\\n==In popular culture==\\n\\n\\'\\'Arziyan\\'\\', a \\'\\'[[qawwali]]\\'\\' in the film \\'\\'[[Delhi 6]]\\'\\' (2009) composed by [[A.

The \\'\\'Harusame\\'\\'-class of destroyers were the first destroyers to be built in Japan. <ref> Jentsura, Warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy, 1869-1945 </ref>\\n\\n==Background==\\nThe \\'\\'Harusame\\'\\'-class destroyers were part of the 1894 [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] ten-year expansion and modernization plan for based on lessons learned in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]]. In the second phase of this plan, from fiscal 1897, after 12 destroyers had been imported from the [[United Kingdom]], budget cutbacks reduced the number of new vessels to only four more (two each from the [[Akizuki class destroyer|\\'\\'Akitsuki\\'\\']] and [[Shirakumo class destroyer|\\'\\'Shirakumo\\'\\'-classes]].\\n\\nIn fiscal year 1900, the Imperial Japanese Navy decided to cancel plans for a torpedo boat tender, which freed funds to purchase four additional destroyers. Likewise, in fiscal 1903, the cancellation of six planned utility vessels freed funds to produce an additional three destroyers.\\n\\nIn order to cut costs and to help develop the Japanese shipbuilding industry, it was decided to construct all seven of the new destroyers at Japanese yards. The first four were built at the [[Yokosuka Naval Arsenal]], and the remaining three at the [[Kure Naval Arsenal]]. <ref> Howarth, The Fighting Ships of the Rising Sun</ref> \\n\\n==Design==\\nThe \\'\\'Harusame\\'\\'-class ships attempted to incorporate the best features of the existing destroyer designs in the Navy\\'s inventory. The [[Bow (ship)|bow]] design and front half of the vessel was substantially identical to the previous [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow-built]] [[Ikazuchi class destroyer|\\'\\'Ikazuchi\\'\\'-class]], whereas the aft section was a copy of the previous [[John I. Thornycroft & Company |Thornycroft-built]] [[Murakumo class destroyer|\\'\\'Murakumo\\'\\'-class]].\\n\\nExternally, the design retained the four-[[smokestack]]s of the \\'\\'Ikazuchi\\'\\', and the improved [[rudder]] design of the \\'\\'Akitsuki\\'\\'–class. The main design issue was with the [[coal|coal-fired]] [[steam engine|triple expansion steam engines]], which copied the design of the Yarrow [[water-tube boiler]]s. As with the \\'\\'Ikazuchi\\'\\'-class, the rated power was 7,000 [[Horsepower#Shaft horsepower (shp)|shp]]; however, problems with quality of the materials and construction meant that actual maximum power was considerably less. <ref>Evans, Kaigun: Strategy, Tactics, and Technology in the Imperial Japanese Navy, 1887-1941</ref>\\n\\nArmament was the similar to the previous \\'\\'Ikazuchi\\'\\' and \\'\\'Murakumo\\'\\' classes; i.e. two [[British ordnance terms#QF|QF]] [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|12 pounder]] on a bandstand on the [[forecastle]], four [[QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss]] (two sided abreast the [[conning tower]], and two sided between the funnels and two single tubes for 18 inch [[torpedo]]es. <ref>Jane, The Imperial Japanese Navy</ref>\\n\\n==Operational history==\\nAll of the \\'\\'Harusame\\'\\'-class destroyers were completed in time to be used in combat during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904-1905, with the final three vessels completed just in time to take part in the crucial final [[Battle of Tsushima]]. \\'\\'Hayatori\\'\\' was lost after striking a [[naval mine]] during the conflict off of [[Lüshunkou|Port Arthur]] {{coor dm|38|47|S|121|30|E}}<ref>Nishida, Imperial Japanese Navy </ref>.\\n\\n\\'\\'Harusame\\'\\' was lost in 1911 after running aground in Matoya Bay in [[Mie Prefecture]], Japan {{coor dm|34|25|N|137|00|E}}<ref>Nishida, Imperial Japanese Navy </ref>. On [[1912-08-28]], the remaining five vessels were derated to third-class destroyers and were removed from front line combat service.

In the two thousand years of the Christian faith, about 70 million believers have been killed for their faith, of whom 45.5 million or 65% were in the twentieth century according to \"The New Persecuted\" (\"I Nuovi Perseguitati\").<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/vnews/getstory.asp?number=26402 \"20th Century Saw 65% of Christian Martyrs\", 10 May 2002] -- [[Zenit News Agency]]</ref>\\n\\n===Persecution of Hindus===\\n{{main|Persecution of Hindus}}\\nPersecution of Hindus refers to the [[religious persecution]] inflicted upon [[Hindu]]s.

Their forcible expulsion from the state caused the death of hundreds due to exposure, starvation, and resulting illnesses.  The Mormons suffered through [[tarring and feathering]], their lands and possessions being repeatedly taken from them, mob attacks, false imprisonments, and the US sending an army to Utah to deal with the \"Mormon problem\" in the [[Utah War]].  A government militia slaughtered Mormons in what is now known as the [[Haun\\'s Mill massacre]].

Persecution may refer to unwarranted arrest, imprisonment, beating, torture, or execution. It also may refer to the confiscation or destruction of property, or incitement to hate Muslims.  Persecution can extend beyond those who perceive themselves as Muslims to include those who are perceived by others as Muslims, or to Muslims which are considered by fellow Muslims as non-Muslims.\\n\\n===Persecution of Falun Gong===\\n{{main|History of Falun Gong}}\\n[[Falun Gong]] was introduced to the general public by [[Li Hongzhi]](李洪志) in [[Changchun]], [[China]], in 1992.

The ongoing systemic and systematic assault upon Indigenous places of worship, sacred images and objects and upon religious specialists begins with the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]]. \\n\\nHernan Cortez practiced a systematic policy of destroying indigenous places of worship and replacing them with Roman Catholic Churches and images of various christian saints, his personal favorite was a femail image associated with a crescent moon and a cross bearing the image of a dead man. He and many of his soldiers and followers regarded the invasion of the Western Hemisphere as a continuation of the Spanish [[Reconquista]], a [[Holy War]], in which tolerance had no place. He and his compatriots singled out Indigenous religious specialists of all kinds as \"demonic\" and they were often tortured to convert or summarily executed as a toxic pest if they did not. Vast quantities of sacred images have been destroyed sacred texts burned and the people converted by force of arms and the threat of death or torture. \\n\\nFollowing the establishment of European (Christian) colonies controlling the entirety of Indigenous lands in the Western Hemisphere, these persecutorial activities continued. Indeed, the so called Colonial and National periods often represent a worsening of foreign persecutions.\\n\\nThe Modern European Colonial States (occupying almost the entirety of the Western Hemisphere) consistently confiscate important sacred sites and desacralize them to profit from the secular tourism industry.\\n\\nIn many parts of the Western Hemisphere, Indigenous religious specialists remain subject to European or Christian \"laws\" which demonize both practice and practitioner as satanic witches.\\nIndeed, the attack upon those who would integrate indigenous sacred plants into their lives and worship is now a multimillion dollar industry supported by taxpayer funds, confiscations and by favored European religious organizations.\\n\\n==Ethnic persecution==\\n{{main|Ethnic persecution}}\\nEthnic persecution refers to perceived [[persecution]] based on [[ethnicity]]. Its meaning is parallel to [[racism]], (based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]).\\n\\n===Persecution of Germans===\\n{{main|Organised persecution of ethnic Germans}}\\nThe persecution of [[ethnic German]]s refers to systematic activity against groups of ethnic Germans based on their ethnicity. \\n\\nHistorically, this has been due to two causes: the German population were considered, whether factually or not, linked with German nationalist regimes such as those of the [[Nazis]] or [[Kaiser Wilhelm]]. This was the case in the World War I era persecution of Germans in the [[United States]], and also in Eastern and Central Europe following the end of World War II.  While many victims of these persecutions did not, in fact, have any connection to those regimes, cooperation between German minority organisations and Nazi regime did occur, as the example of [[Selbstschutz]] shows, which is still used as a pretense of hostilities against those who did not take part in such organisations. After World War II, many such [[Volksdeutsche]] were killed or driven from their homes in acts of vengeance, others in ethnic cleansing of territories prior to populating them with citizens of the annexing country. In other cases (e.g. in the case of the formerly large German-speaking populations of Russia, Estonia, or the Transylvanian (Siebenbürgen) German minority in Rumania and the Balkans) such persecution was a crime committed against innocent communities who had played no part in the [[Third Reich]].\\n\\n==Persecution based on genetics==\\n===Persecution of albinos===\\n{{main|Persecution of albinos}}\\nPersecution of albinos is based on the belief that certain body parts of [[albinistic]] people transmit magical powers. This [[superstition]], which is present in some parts of [[East Africa]], has been promulgated and exploited by [[witch doctor]]s and others who use such body parts as ingredients in rituals, concoctions and potions with the claim that their [[witchcraft|magic]] will bring prosperity to the user. As a result albinos have been persecuted, killed and dismembered, and graves of albinistics dug up and desecrated. At the same time albinos have also been ostracized and even killed because they are presumed to bring bad luck.\\n\\n==See also==\\n\\n* [[Persecution of Ahmadiyya]]\\n* [[Discrimination]]\\n* [[Persecution complex]]\\n* [http://www.greenlanguage.com/_GreenLanguage/Page_04.asp Language alternatives to creating and being persecutors]\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n[[Category:Core issues in ethics]]\\n[[Category:Persecution|*]]\\n\\n[[ar:اضطهاد]]\\n[[cs:Perzekuce]]\\n[[da:Forfølgelse]]\\n[[es:Persecución]]\\n[[eo:Persekuto]]\\n[[ko:박해]]\\n[[it:Persecuzione]]\\n[[ja:迫害]]\\n[[pt:Perseguição]]\\n[[fi:Vaino]]\\n[[sw:Dhuluma]]\\n[[th:การไล่ทำร้ายและสังหาร]]\\n[[tr:Zulüm]]\\n[[ta:பேரினவாதம்]]'],\n",
