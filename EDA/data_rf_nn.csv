'''Funerary art''' is any work of [[art]] forming, or placed in, a repository for the remains of the [[death|dead]]. [[Tomb]] is a general term for the repository, while [[grave goods]] are objects—other than the primary human remains—which have been placed inside.<ref>Hammond, 58–9 characterizes [[Dismemberment|disarticulated]] human skeletal remains packed in body bags and incorporated into [[Formative stage|Pre-Classic]] [[Mesoamerica]]n [[mass burial]]s (along with a set of primary remains) at Cuello, [[Belize]] as ""human grave goods"".</ref> Such objects may include the personal possessions of the deceased, objects specially created for the burial, or miniature versions of things believed to be needed in an [[afterlife]].  Knowledge of many non-literate cultures is drawn largely from these sources.

Funerary art can serve many cultural functions.  It can play a role in burial rites, serve as an article for use by the dead in the afterlife, and celebrate the life and accomplishments of the dead, whether as part of kinship-centered practices of [[ancestor veneration]] or as a publicly directed [[Dynasty|dynastic]] display.  It can also function as a reminder of the mortality of humankind, as an expression of cultural values and roles, and help to propitiate the spirits of the dead, maintaining their benevolence and preventing their unwelcome intrusion into the affairs of the living.  

The deposit of objects with an apparent aesthetic intention may go back to the [[Neanderthal]]s over 50,000 years ago,<ref>Depending on the interpretation of sites like the [[Shanidar Cave]] in Iraq. Bogucki, 64–66 summarizes the debate.  Gargett takes a hostile view but accepts (p. 29 etc.) that many or most scholars do not. See also Pettitt.</ref> and is found in almost all subsequent cultures—the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] culture, which has little, is a notable exception.<ref>""[Hindu] disposal of their dead by cremation and a belief in reincarnation tended to obviate an inherent interest in permanent markers"". Groseclose, 23</ref> Many of the best-known artistic creations of past cultures—from the [[Egyptian pyramids]] and the [[KV62|Tutankhamun treasure]] to the [[Terracotta Army]] surrounding the tomb of the [[Qin Shi Huang|Qin Emperor]], the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]], the [[Sutton Hoo]] ship burial and the [[Taj Mahal]]—are tombs or objects found in and around them.  In most instances, specialized funeral art was produced for the powerful and wealthy, although the burials of ordinary people might include simple monuments and grave goods, usually from their possessions.

An important factor in the development of traditions of funerary art is the division between what was intended to be visible to visitors or the public after completion of the [[funeral]] ceremonies.<ref>See for example the chapter ""Tombs for the Living and the Dead"", Insoll 176–87</ref>  The [[Tutankhamun]] treasure, for example, though exceptionally lavish, was never intended to be seen again by humans after it was deposited, while the exterior of the Pyramids were a permanent and highly effective demonstration of the power of their creators.  A similar division can be seen in grand East Asian tombs. In other cultures nearly all the art connected with the burial, except for limited grave goods, was intended to remain visible to the public, or at least those admitted by the custodians.  In these cultures traditions such as the sculpted  [[sarcophagus]] and [[tomb monument]]s of the Greek and Roman empires, and later the Christian world, have flourished. The [[mausoleum]] intended for visiting was the grandest type of tomb in the classical world, and later common in [[Islam]]ic culture.

==Common terms==
A [[tumulus]], mound, [[kurgan]], or [[long barrow]] covered important [[burial]]s in many cultures, and the body may be placed in a sarcophagus, usually of stone, or a [[coffin]], usually of wood.  A mausoleum is a building erected mainly as a tomb, taking its name from the Mausoleum of Mausolus at [[Halicarnassus]].  [[Stele]] is a term for erect stones that are often what are now called [[gravestone]]s.  [[Ship burial]]s are mostly found in coastal Europe, while [[chariot burial]]s are found widely across [[Eurasia]]. [[Catacombs]], of which the most famous examples are those in [[Catacombs of Rome|Rome]] and [[Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa|Alexandria]], are underground cemeteries connected by tunnelled passages.  A large group of burials with traces remaining above ground can be called a [[necropolis]]; if there are no such visible structures, it is a [[grave field]].  A [[cenotaph]] is a memorial without a burial.<ref>See any well-regarded survey of the [[history of art]] or of [[history of architecture|architecture]], such as ''[[Gardner's Art Through the Ages]]'' or the most recent edition of Sir [[Banister Fletcher]]'s ''A History of Architecture.''</ref>

Related genres of commemorative art for the dead take many forms, such as the ''[[moai]]'' figures of [[Easter Island]], apparently a type of sculpted [[ancestor portrait]], though hardly individualized.<ref>[http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aoa/h/hoa_hakananaia.aspx Hoa Hakananai'a] British Museum, accessed 26 April, 2010</ref>  These are common in cultures as diverse as Ancient Rome and China, in both of which they are kept in the houses of the descendants, rather than being buried.<ref>Toynbee, 47–48, on Ancient Rome. Stewart and Rawski's book is entirely devoted to Chinese ancestor portraits. See Chapter 1 etc.</ref>  Many cultures have [[psychopomp]] figures, such as the Greek [[Hermes]] and Etruscan [[Charun]], who help conduct the spirits of the dead into the afterlife.

== Pre-history==
{{Main|Megalith}}
[[Image:paulnabrone.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Poulnabrone dolmen]] in Ireland covered at least 22 bodies of the [[Neolithic]] period]]

Most of humanity's oldest known archaeological constructions are tombs.<ref>Although the purpose of megalithic structures is not always clear, and of the very oldest, while [[Nevali Cori]] in Turkey contains burials, [[Göbekli Tepe]] appears not to.</ref> Mostly [[megalith]]ic, the earliest instances date to within a few centuries of each other, yet show a wide diversity of form and purpose. Tombs in the [[Iberian peninsula]] have been dated through [[thermoluminescence]] to c. 4510 BCE, and some burials at the [[Carnac stones]] in [[Brittany]] also date back to the fifth millennium BCE.<ref>Mohen, 70</ref> The commemorative value of such burial sites are indicated by the fact that, at some stage, they became elevated, and that the constructs, almost from the earliest, sought to be monumental. This effect was often achieved by encapsulating a single corpse in a basic pit, surrounded by an elaborate ditch and drain. Over-ground commemoration is thought to be tied to the concept of collective memory, and these early tombs were likely intended as a form of [[ancestor-worship]], a development available only to communities that had advanced to the stage of settled livestock and formed social roles and relationships and specialized sectors of activity.<ref>Mohen, 87</ref>

In [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] societies, a great variety of tombs are found, with tumulus mounds, megaliths and pottery as recurrent elements. In Eurasia, a [[dolmen]] is the exposed stone framework for a [[chamber tomb]] originally covered by earth to make a mound which no longer exists.  Stones may be carved with geometric patterns ([[petroglyph]]s), for example [[cup and ring mark]]s.  Group tombs were made, the social context of which is hard to decipher. [[Urn]] burials, where bones are buried in a pottery container, either in a more elaborate tomb, or by themselves, are widespread, by no means restricted to the [[Urnfield culture]] which is named after them, or even to Eurasia.  [[Menhir]]s, or ""[[standing stone]]s"", seem often to mark graves or serve as memorials,<ref>Kipfer, ""Menhir"", 348</ref> while the later [[runestone]]s and [[image stone]]s often are [[cenotaph]]s, or memorials apart from the grave itself; these continue into the Christian period. The [[Senegambian stone circles]] are a later African form of tomb markers.<ref>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1226 Stone Circles of Senegambia – UNESCO World Heritage Centre], accessed April 28, 2010</ref>

== Ancient Egypt and Nubia==
{{main|Art of ancient Egypt}}
[[Image:Egypte louvre 239 masque.jpg|thumb|Egyptian ceramic coffin mask|alt=An oversized, shallow mask depicting a large face. The face is roughly oval-shaped, but the top of the mask is a horizontal line just above the eyebrows, leaving the entire mask roughly triangular. The entire face is flattened, but the bulbous nose protrudes away from the face. The eyes are large and almond shaped, and both the eyes and braided eyebrows are disproportionally large in comparison with the mouth, which has full lips. The front of the face is clean-shaven, but below the chin, there is a long, narrow, pointed, braided false beard that was characteristic of ancient Egyptian royalty.]]

Egyptian funerary art was inseparably connected to the [[Ancient Egyptian religion|religious belief]] that life continued after death – even more, it expressed a belief that ""death is a mere phase of life"".<ref>Groenewegen-Frankfort, 80</ref> Aesthetic objects and images connected with this belief were partially intended to preserve material goods, wealth and status for the journey between this life and the next,<ref>Stone, 37</ref> and to ""commemorate the life of the tomb owner ... depict performance of the burial rites, and in general present an environment that would be conducive to the tomb owner's rebirth.""<ref>Kampen&nbsp;et&nbsp;al, 31</ref> In this context, Egyptian [[mummy|mummies]] encased in one or more layers of decorated coffin, are famous; [[canopic jar]]s preserved the internal organs. A special category of [[Ancient Egyptian funerary texts]] clarify the purposes of the burial customs.  The early [[mastaba]] type of tomb had a sealed underground burial chamber but an offering-chamber on the ground level for visits by the living, a pattern repeated in later types of tomb. An effigy of the deceased might be walled up in a ''[[serdab]]'' connected to the offering chamber by vents that allowed the smell of [[incense]] to reach the effigy.<ref>Maspero, 111—127, with ''serdabs'' 124—125</ref>   The walls of important tomb-chambers and offering chambers were heavily decorated with [[relief]]s in stone or sometimes wood, or paintings, depicting religious scenes, portraits of the deceased, and at some periods vivid images of everyday life, depicting the afterlife. The chamber decoration usually centred on a ""false door"", through which only the soul of the deceased could pass, to received the offerings left by the living.<ref>Robins, 51–55, 66–71, 218–219, and see index for other periods. Tomb styles changed considerably over the course of Egyptian history.</ref> 

[[Representation (arts)|Representational art]], such as individual portraiture of the deceased, is found extremely early on and continues into the Roman period in the [[Encaustic painting|encaustic]] [[Faiyum mummy portraits|Faiyum funerary portraits]] applied to coffins. However, it is still hotly debated whether there was realistic [[portraiture in Ancient Egypt]].<ref>Spanel, 23</ref>  The purpose of the life-sized [[reserve head]]s found in burial shafts or tombs of nobles of the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|Fourth dynasty]] is not well understood; they may have been a discreet method of eliding an edict by [[Khufu]] forbidding nobles from creating statues of themselves, or may have protected the deceased's spirit from harm or magically eliminated any evil in it, or perhaps functioned as alternate containers for the spirit if the body should be harmed in any way.<ref>Atiya & El Shawahy, 73</ref> 
 
Architectural works such as the massive [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] and two smaller ones built during the [[Old Kingdom]] in the [[Giza Necropolis]] and (much later, from about 1500&nbsp;BCE) the tombs in the [[Valley of the Kings]] were built for royalty and the elite. The [[Theban Necropolis]] was later an important site for [[mortuary temple]]s and mastaba tombs.  The [[Kushite]] kings who conquered Egypt and ruled as pharaohs during the [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-fifth dynasty]] were greatly influenced by Egyptian funerary customs, employing mummification, canopic jars and ''[[ushabti]]'' funerary figurines. They also built the [[Nubian pyramids]], which in both size and design more closely resemble the smaller [[Seventeenth dynasty of Egypt|Seventeenth dynasty]] pyramids at Thebes than those of the Old Kingdom near Memphis.<ref>Boardman, Edwards ''et al'', 688–9</ref>

Lower-class citizens used common forms of funerary art—including ''[[shabti]]'' figurines (to perform any labor that might be required of the dead person in the afterlife), [[Dung beetle#Scarab in Ancient Egypt|models of the scarab beetle]] and books of the dead—which they believed would protect them in the afterlife.<ref>James, 122</ref> During the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], miniature wooden or clay models depicting scenes from everyday life became popular additions to tombs. In an attempt to duplicate the activities of the living in the afterlife, these models show laborers, houses, boats and even military formations which are scale representations of the ideal ancient Egyptian afterlife.<ref>Robins, 74</ref>

==Ancient Greece==

The man's robe is open, exposing his penis. He holds the hand of the woman.]]

The ancient Greeks did not generally leave elaborate grave goods, except for a [[Charon's obol|coin to pay Charon]], the [[Charon (mythology)|ferryman to Hades]], and pottery; however the ''epitaphios'' or [[Funeral oration (ancient Greece)|funeral oration]]&nbsp;from which the word [[epitaph]] comes&nbsp;was regarded as of great importance, and [[animal sacrifice]]s were made.   Those who could afford them erected stone monuments, which was one of the functions of ''[[kouros]]'' statues in the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic period]] before about 500&nbsp;BCE.  These were not intended as portraits, but during the [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic period]], realistic portraiture of the deceased was introduced and family groups were often depicted in [[bas-relief]] on monuments, usually surrounded by an architectural frame.<ref>Boardman, 212, 15</ref>  The walls of tomb chambers were often painted in [[fresco]], although few examples have survived in as good condition as the [[Tomb of the Diver]] from southern Italy or the tombs at [[Vergina]] in Macedon.  Almost the only surviving painted portraits in the classical Greek tradition are found in Egypt rather than Greece. The [[Fayum mummy portraits]], from the very end of the classical period, were portrait faces, in a [[Greco-Roman world|Graeco-Roman]] style, attached to mummies.<ref>Oakes & Gahlin, 236</ref>

Early Greek burials were frequently marked above ground by a large piece of [[Pottery of ancient Greece|pottery]], and remains were also buried in urns.  Pottery continued to be used extensively inside tombs and graves throughout the classical period.<ref>Boardman, 26 and passim</ref>   The ''[[Larnax (Archaeology)|larnax]]'' is a small coffin or ash-chest, usually of decorated [[terracotta]]. The two-handled ''[[loutrophoros]]'' was primarily associated with weddings, as it was used to carry water for the [[nuptial]] bath. However, it was also placed in the tombs of the unmarried, ""presumably to make up in some way for what they had missed in life.""<ref>Richter, 57</ref> The one-handled ''[[lekythos]]'' had many household uses, but outside the household, its principal use was the decoration of tombs.<ref>Henderson, 135</ref> Scenes of a [[descent to the underworld]] of [[Hades]] were often painted on these, with the dead depicted beside [[Hermes]], Charon or both—though usually only with Charon.<ref>Wright, 391</ref> Small pottery figurines are often found, though it is hard to decide if these were made especially for placement in tombs; in the case of the [[Hellenistic]] [[Tanagra figurines]], this seems probably not the case.<ref>Boardman, 212–13</ref> But silverware is more often found around the fringes of the Greek world, as in the royal [[Macedon]]ian tombs of [[Vergina]], or in the neighbouring cultures such as those of [[Thrace]] or the [[Scythians]].<ref>Boardman, 149–50</ref>

The extension of the Greek world after the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] brought peoples with different tomb-making traditions into the [[Hellenistic]] sphere, resulting in new formats for art in Greek styles.<ref>Boardman, 151–154, and throughout the section on the period</ref>  A generation before Alexander, Mausolus was a Hellenized [[satrap]] or semi-independent ruler under the [[Persian Empire]], whose enormous tomb (begun 353 BCE) was wholly exceptional in the Greek world – together with the Pyramids it was the only tomb to be be included in the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]].  The exact form of the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]], which gave the name to the form, is now unclear, and there are several alternative reconstructions that seek to reconcile the archaeological evidence with descriptions in literature.<ref>Boardman, 126–127. Apart from those at the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]] article, there are several from Lethaby's 1908 work [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Turkey/_Periods/Greek/_Texts/LETGKB/Mausoleum*.html here], and one illustrated in Boardman.</ref>  It had the size and some elements of the design of the [[Greek temple]], but was much more vertical, with a square base and a pyramidal roof.  There were quantities of large sculpture.<ref>Boardman, 126–127</ref>  Other local rulers adapted the high-relief temple [[frieze]] for very large sarcophagi, starting a tradition which was to exert a great influence on Western art up to 18th century [[Neo-Classicism]].  The late 4th century [[Alexander Sarcophagus]] was in fact made for another Hellenized Eastern ruler, one of a number of important sarcophagi found at [[Sidon]] in the modern [[Lebanon]].  The two long sides show Alexander's great victory at the [[Battle of Issus]] and a lion hunt; such violent scenes were common on ostentatious classical sarcophagi from this period onwards, with a particular revival in Roman art of the 2nd century.  More peaceful mythological scenes were popular on smaller sarcophagi, especially of [[Bacchus]].<ref>Boardman, 172–173, 339–344</ref>

==Etruscan==

There is a marked contrast between the high relief busts of their upper bodies and the very flattened lower bodies and legs. They have almond shaped eyes and long braided hair, and are smiling widely. The man has a beard that is bobbed. The woman's hands are gesticulating in front of her as if she was holding something that is no longer there, or perhaps gesturing while speaking. The man has his right arm draped around the woman's shoulders in an intimate pose, and his right hand on her shoulder also appears to once have held some item. His left hand rests palm up in the crook of the woman's left elbow.
]]

Objects connected with death, in particular [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] and [[cinerary urn]]s, form the basis of much of current knowledge of the ancient [[Etruscan civilization]] and [[Etruscan art|its art]], which once competed with the [[culture of ancient Rome]], but was eventually absorbed into it.<ref>Holiday, 73</ref> The sarcophagi and the lids of the urns often incorporate a reclining image of the deceased. The reclining figures in some Etruscan funerary art are shown using the ''[[mano cornuta]]'' to protect the grave.<ref>de&nbsp;Grummond 1997, 359</ref>

The motif of the funerary art of the 7th and 6th centuries&nbsp;BCE was typically a feasting scene, sometimes with dancers and musicians, or athletic competitions. Household bowls, cups, and pitchers are sometimes found in the graves, along with food such as eggs, pomegranates, honey, grapes and olives for use in the afterlife.<ref>de&nbsp;Grummond 2006, 231</ref><ref>de&nbsp;Grummond&nbsp;1997,&nbsp;93</ref> From the 5th century, the mood changed to more somber and gruesome scenes of parting, where the deceased are shown leaving their loved ones,<ref>Johnston,&nbsp;489</ref> often surrounded by underworld demons, and psychopomps, such as [[Charun]] or the winged female [[Vanth]]. The underworld figures are sometimes depicted as gesturing impatiently for a human to be taken away.<ref name=""D1985"">Davies, 632</ref> The handshake was another common motif, as the dead took leave of the living.<ref name=""D1985"" /> This often took place in front of or near a closed double doorway, presumably the portal to the underworld. Evidence in some art, however, suggests that the ""handshake took place at the other end of the journey, and represents the dead being greeted in the Underworld"".<ref name=""D1985"" />

== Ancient Rome ==

Marble, Roman artwork from the 1st century BC imitating the Greek classical style of the 5th century BC. From [[Rhodes]].]] 

The burial customs of the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] were influenced by both of the first significant cultures whose territories they conquered as their state expanded, namely the Greeks of [[Magna Graecia]] and the Etruscans.<ref>Toynbee, Chapter I</ref>  The original Roman custom was [[cremation]], after which the burnt remains were kept in a pot, ash-chest or urn, often in a ''[[columbarium]]''; pre-Roman burials around Rome often used hut-urns—little pottery houses.<ref>Hall, 15</ref>  From about the second century&nbsp;CE, [[inhumation]] (burial of unburnt remains) in sarcophagi, often elaborately carved, became more fashionable for those who could afford it.<ref>Toynbee, 39–40</ref>  Greek-style medallion portrait sculptures on a ''stela'', or small mausoleum for the rich, housing either an urn or sarcophagus, were often placed in a location such as a roadside, where it would be very visible to the living and perpetuate the memory of the dead.  Often a couple are shown, signifying a longing for reunion in the afterlife rather than a double burial.<ref>Toynbee, Chapter IV; Hall, 53</ref> 

In later periods, life-size sculptures of the deceased reclining as though at a meal or social gathering are found, a common Etruscan style.  Family tombs for the grandest late Roman families, like the [[Tomb of the Scipios]], were large mausoleums with facilities for visits by the living, including kitchens and bedrooms.  The [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], built for [[Hadrian]], was later converted into a fortress.  Compared to the Etruscans, though, there was less emphasis on provision of a lifestyle for the deceased, although paintings of useful objects or pleasant activities, like hunting, are seen.<ref>Toynbee, 38</ref>  Ancestor portraits, usually in the form of wax masks, were kept in the home, apparently often in little cupboards,<ref>Toynbee, 31&nbsp;(illustration)</ref> although grand patrician families kept theirs on display in the ''[[Domus|atrium]]''.  They were worn in the funeral processions of members of the family by persons wearing appropriate costume for the figure represented, as described by [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Polybius]].  Pliny also describes the custom of having a bust-portrait of an ancestor painted on a round bronze shield (''[[clipeus]]''), and having it hung in a temple or other public place.  No examples of either type have survived.<ref>Hall, 15, 35, 78</ref> 

By the late [[Roman Republic|Republic]] there was considerable competition among wealthy Romans for the best locations for tombs, which lined all the approach roads to the city up to the walls, and a variety of exotic and unusual designs sought to catch the attention of the passer-by and so perpetuate the memory of the deceased and increase the prestige of their family.  Examples include the [[Tomb of Eurysaces the Baker]], a [[freedman]], the [[Pyramid of Cestius]], and the Mausoleum of [[Caecilia Metella (daughter of Metellus Creticus)|Caecilia Metella]], all built within a few decades of the start of the [[Common Era]].<ref>Petersen, 95—105; see also Boardman, 240—241 on Eurysaces' tomb.</ref>    

In Italy, sarcophagi were mostly intended to be set against the wall of the tomb, and only decorated on three sides, in contrast to the free-standing styles of Greece and the Eastern Empire. The relief scenes of Hellenistic art became even more densely crowded in later Roman sarcophagi, as for example in the 2nd century [[Portonaccio sarcophagus]], and various styles and forms emerged, such as the columnar type with an ""architectural background of columns and niches for its figures"".<ref>Boardman, 339</ref>  A well-known Early Christian example is the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]], used for an important new convert who died in 359. Many sarcophagi from leading centres were exported around the Empire.<ref>Boardman, 339–344; Hall, 78–80</ref>  The Romans had already developed the expression of religious and philosophical ideas in narrative scenes from [[Greek mythology]], treated [[allegorically]];<ref>Hall, 54–61</ref> they later transferred this habit to Christian ideas, using Biblical scenes.<ref>Hall, 77–82</ref>

==China==
[[File:SAM Art Ladder military guardian.jpg|thumb|""Military Guardian"", Chinese funerary statue. Seattle Art Museum, Seattle, Washington.]]
Funerary art varied greatly across Chinese history. Tombs of early rulers rival the ancient Egyptians for complexity and value of grave goods, and have been similarly pillaged over the centuries by [[tomb robber]]s.  For a long time, literary references to [[jade burial suit]]s were regarded by scholars as fanciful myths, but a number of examples were excavated in the 20th century, and it is now believed that they were relatively common among early rulers.  Knowledge of pre-dynastic Chinese culture has been expanded by spectacular discoveries at [[Sanxingdui]] and other sites.  Very large tumuli could be erected, and later, mausoleums.  Several special large shapes of [[Shang dynasty]] bronze ritual vessels may have been made for burial only; the [[Tomb of Fu Hao]] (c BCE 1200) is one of the few undisturbed royal tombs of the period to have been excavated—most funerary art has appeared on the art market without archaeological context.<ref>See for example  Merriman, 297</ref> 

The discovery in 1974 of the [[Terracotta army]] located the tomb of the [[First Qin Emperor]] (died 210 BCE), but the main tumulus, of which literary descriptions survive,  has not been excavated.  Remains surviving above ground from several imperial tombs of the [[Han dynasty]] show traditions maintained until the end of imperial rule.  The tomb itself is an ""underground palace"" beneath a sealed tumulus surrounded by a wall, with several buildings set at some distance away down avenues for the observation of rites of veneration, and the accomodation of both permanent staff and those visiting to perform rites, as well as gateways, towers and other buildings.  This complex is approached by a ""spirit road"", sometimes several kilometres long, lined by statues of guardian figures, based on both humans and animals, and [[Bixi (tortoise)|''bixi'']] or stelae mounted on tortoises. In Han tombs the guardian figures are mainly of ""lions"" and ""[[chimera]]s""; in later periods they are much more varied.<ref>Sickman & Soper, 57-66; see also [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4gNk5HzIIKgC&pg=PA31&dq=Han+cemetery+marker+que&lr=&ei=LeLfS_P-NYvONd_D-M8K&cd=4#v=onepage&q&f=false the diagram here]</ref>  A looted tomb with fine paintings is the [[Empress Dowager Wenming tomb]] of the 5th century CE, and the many tombs of the 7th century [[Tang dynasty]] [[Qianling Mausoleum]] group are an early example of a generally well-preserved ensemble.<ref>Sickman & Soper, 155</ref>  The [[complex of Goguryeo Tombs]], from a kingdom of the 5th to 7th centuries which included modern [[Korea]], are especially rich in paintings.  Only one of the [[Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties]] has been excavated, in 1956, with such [[Ming Dynasty Tombs|disastrous results]] for the conservation of the thousands of objects found, that the current policy is to leave them undisturbed.<ref>Evasdottir, 158—160</ref>   

The [[Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum]] in Hong Kong displays a far humbler middle-class Han dynasty tomb, and the mid-2nd century Wu Family tombs of [[Jiaxiang County]], [[Shandong]] are the most important group of commoner tombs for funerary stones.  The walls of both the offering and burial chambers of tombs of commoners from the Han period may be decorated with stone slabs carved or engraved in very low relief with crowded and varied scenes, which are now the main indication of the style of the lost palace frescos of the period.  A cheaper option was to use large clay tiles which were carved or impressed before firing.<ref>Sickman & Soper, 77-84</ref>  After the introduction of Buddhism, carved ""funerary couches"" featured similar scenes, now mostly religious.<ref>Sickman & Soper, 120-121</ref> During the Han Dynasty, [[Science_and_technology_of_the_Han_Dynasty#Ceramic_model_buildings|miniature ceramic models]] of buildings were often made to accompany the deceased in the graves; to them is owed much of what is known of ancient Chinese architecture. Later, during the [[Six Dynasties]], sculptural miniatures depicting buildings, monuments, people and animals adorned the tops of the ''[[hunping]]'' funerary vessels.<ref name=dien>Dien, 214–215</ref>  The outsides of tombs often featured monumental brick or stone-carved pillar-gates (que 闕); an example from 121 CE appears to be the earliest surviving Chinese architectural structure standing above ground.<ref>Sickman & Soper, 376 (illustrated)</ref> 

Early burial customs show a strong belief in an afterlife and a spirit path to it that needed facilitating.  Funerals and memorials were also an opportunity to reaffirm such important cultural values as [[filial piety]] and ""the honor and respect due to seniors, the duties incumbent on juniors""<ref>Thorp &amp;  Vinograd, 144</ref> The common Chinese funerary symbol of a woman in the door may represent a ""basic male fantasy of an elysian afterlife with no restrictions: in all the doorways of the houses stand available women looking for newcomers to welcome into their chambers""<ref>Goldin, 548</ref> Han Dynasty inscriptions often describe the filial mourning for their subjects,<ref>Brown, 44</ref> for example text from a funeral [[stele]] for the daughter of a [[scholar-official]] of the dynasty, which described the ""hurt and grief"" of her two sons:<ref>Brown, 77</ref>

Murals painted on the walls of the [[Complex of Goguryeo Tombs|Goguryeo Tombs]] are examples of Korean painting from its [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] era. Although thousands of these tombs have been found, only about 100 have murals.<ref>UNESCO, ''Preservation of the Koguryo Kingdom Tombs'', 24</ref> These tombs are often named for the dominating theme of the murals – these include the Tomb of the Dancers, the Tomb of the Hunters, the Tomb of the Four Spirits, and the Tomb of the Wrestlers.<ref>Lee, 64</ref> Heavenly bodies are a common motif, as are depictions of events from the lives of the royalty and nobles whose bodies had been entombed. The former include the sun, represented as a [[three-legged bird]] inside a wheel,<ref>UNESCO, ''Preservation of the Koguryo Kingdom Tombs'', 4</ref> and the various constellations, including especially the [[Four Symbols (Chinese constellation)|Four directional constellations]]: the [[Azure Dragon]] of the East, the [[Vermilion Bird]] of the South, the [[White Tiger (Chinese constellation)|White Tiger]]  of the West, and the [[Black Tortoise]] of the North.<ref>Park 33–4</ref>

The [[Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty]] in [[Korea]], built between 1408 and 1966, reflect a combination of Chinese and Japanese traditions, with a tomb mound, often surrounded by a screen wall of stone blocks, and sometimes with stone animal figures above ground, not unlike the Japanese ''haniwa'' figures (see below).  There is usually one or more T-shaped shrine buildings some distance in front of the tomb, which is set in extensive grounds, usually with a hill behind them, and facing a view towards water and distant hills.  They are still a focus for [[ancestor worship]] rituals.  From the 15th century, they became more simple, while retaining a large landscape setting.<ref>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1319/ Unesco] Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty.</ref>

==Japan==
[[Image:HaniwaHorse.JPG|thumb|220px|6th century Japanese ''[[haniwa]]'' clay figure; these were buried with the dead in the [[Kofun]] period (3rd to 6th century CE).]]
The [[Kofun period]] of Japanese history, from the 3rd to 6th centuries CE, is named after ''[[kofun]]'', the often enormous keyhole-shaped Imperial mound-tomb, often on a moated island.  None of these have ever been allowed to be excavated, so their possibly spectacular contents remain unknown.<ref>Paine and Soper, 287–289</ref>   Late examples which have been investigated, such as the [[Kitora Tomb]], had been robbed of most of their contents, but the [[Takamatsuzuka Tomb]] retains mural paintings.  Lower down the social scale in the same period, [[terracotta]] ''haniwa'' figures, as much as a metre high, were deposited on top of aristocratic tombs as grave markers, with others left inside, apparently representing possessions such as horses and houses for use in the afterlife.<ref>Paine and Soper, 24–26, 280–282</ref>  Both ''kofun'' mounds and ''haniwa'' figures appear to have been discontinued as Buddhism became the dominant Japanese religion.<ref>Paine and Soper, 289. See also [[List of National Treasures of Japan (archaeological materials)]]</ref>  

Since then, Japanese tombs have been typically marked by elegant but simple rectangular vertical gravestones with inscriptions.  Funerals are one of the areas in Japanese life where Buddhist customs are followed even by those who followed other traditions, such as [[Shinto]].  The ''[[bodaiji]]'' is a special and very common type of temple whose main purpose is as a venue for rites of ancestor worship, though it is often not the actual burial site.  This was originally a custom of the feudal lords, but was adopted by other classes from about the 16th century. Each family would use a particular ''bodaiji'' over generations, and it might contain a second ""grave"" if the actual burial were elsewhere.  Many later emperors, from the 13th to 19th centuries, are buried simply at the Imperial ''bodaiji'', the [[Tsuki no wa no misasagi]] mausoleum in the [[Sennyū-ji]] temple at [[Kyoto]].<ref>Hall, John Whitney, 381–386</ref>

==The Americas==
[[Image:Shaft tomb culture village scene.jpg|left|thumb|225px|A [[Western Mexico shaft tomb tradition|""shaft tomb""]] tableau from [[Nayarit]], Mexico, 300 BC to AD 600<ref>Smithsonian.</ref>|alt=A ring of twelve dancing figures, arms interlocked around each others' shoulders. They surround one musician in the center of the ring, and a second musician stands behind them.]]
Unlike many Western cultures, that of [[Mesoamerica]] is generally lacking in [[sarcophagi]], with a few notable exceptions such as that of [[Pacal the Great]] or the now-lost sarcophagus from the [[Olmec]] site of [[La Venta]].  Instead, most Mesoamerican funerary art takes the form of grave goods and, in [[Oaxaca]], funerary urns. Two well-known examples of Mesoamerican grave goods are those from [[Jaina Island]], a [[Maya civilization|Maya]] site off the coast of [[Campeche]], and those associated with the [[Western Mexico shaft tomb tradition]].<!-- read te FAC before putting a {{fact}} tag here -->  The tombs of Mayan rulers can only normally be identified by inferences drawn from the lavishness of the grave goods and, with the possible exception of vessels made from stone rather than pottery, these appear to contain no objects specially made for the burial.<ref>Chase and Chase, Chapter 3, especially p. 34</ref>

The Jaina Island graves are noted for their abundance of clay figurines.  Human remains within the roughly 1,000 excavated graves on the island (out of 20,000 total)<ref>Muren.</ref> were found to be accompanied by glassware, slateware, or pottery, as well as one or more ceramic figurines, usually resting on the occupant's chest or held in their hands.  The function of these figurines is not known: due to gender and age mismatches, they are unlikely to be portraits of the grave occupants, although the later figurines are known to be representations of goddesses.<ref>Kubler, 266</ref>

The so-called shaft tomb tradition of western Mexico is known almost exclusively from grave goods, which include hollow ceramic figures, obsidian and shell jewelry, pottery, and other items (see [http://www.flickr.com/photos/petwerewolf/85154232/ this Flickr photo] for a reconstruction).  Of particular note are the various ceramic tableaux including village scenes, for example, players engaged in a [[Mesoamerican ballgame]].  Although these tableaux may merely depict village life, it has been proposed that they instead (or also) depict the underworld.<ref>See Taylor for discussion.</ref> Ceramic dogs are also widely known from looted tombs, and are thought by some to represent [[psychopomp]]s (soul guides),<ref>Coe et al., 103–104, or Mason, 182. In Richardson, 48–9 (""The dog, among the Maya, was considered to be connected with death, and to be the messenger to prepare the way to the hereafter."")</ref> although it should also be noted that dogs were often the major source of protein in ancient Mesoamerica.<ref>Coe, 45 (""The only domestic animals were dogs—the principal source of meat for much of Preclassic Mesoamerica—and turkeys—understandably rare because that familiar bird consumes very large quantities of corn and is thus expensive to raise"".)</ref>
[[Image:Funerary Urn from Oaxaca.jpg|right|thumb|225px|A funerary urn in the shape of a ""bat god"" or a jaguar, from Oaxaca, dated to AD 300–650.  Height: 9.5 in (23 cm). ""The Bat God was one of the important deities of the Maya, many elements of whose religion were shared also by the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]]. The Bat God in particular is known to have been revered also by the Zapotec... He was especially associated…with the underworld.""<ref>Mason, 182. In Richardson, 48–9</ref>|alt=A fearsome mythical creature that may be either a bat or a jaguar.

It squats on four legs each with four clawed toes, with a perfectly round belly.]]
The [[Zapotec civilization]] of Oaxaca is particularly known for its clay funerary urns, such as the ""bat god"" shown at right.  Numerous types of urns have been identified.<ref>Kubler, 163</ref> While some show deities and other supernatural beings, others seem to be portraits.  Art historian [[George Kubler]] is particularly enthusiastic about the craftsmanship of this tradition:

<blockquote>No other American potters ever explored so completely the plastic conditions of wet clay or retained its forms so completely after firing…[they] used its wet and ductile nature for fundamental geometric modelling and cut the material, when half-dry, into smooth planes with sharp edges of an unmatched brilliance and suggestiveness of form.<ref>Kubler, 164</ref></blockquote>

The Maya [[Naj Tunich]] cave tombs and other sites contain paintings, carved stelae, and grave goods in pottery, [[jade]] and metal, including [[death mask]]s. In dry areas, many ancient textiles have been found in graves from South America's [[Paracas culture]], which wrapped its mummies tightly in several layers of elaborately patterned cloth.  Elite [[Moche]] graves, containing especially fine pottery, were incorporated into large [[adobe]] structures also used for [[human sacrifice]]s, such as the [[Huaca de la Luna]].  [[Cultural periods of Peru|Andean cultures]] such as the [[Sican Culture|Sican]] often practiced mummification and left grave goods in precious metals with jewels, including [[tumi]] ritual knives and gold funerary masks, as well as pottery.

The Mimbres of the [[Mogollon culture]] buried their dead with bowls on top of their heads and ceremonially ""killed"" each bowl with a small hole in the center so that the deceased's spirit could rise to another world. Mimbres [[Mogollon culture#Mimbres pottery|funerary bowls]] show scenes of hunting, gambling, planting crops, fishing, making love and giving birth.<ref>Giammattei  and Reichert, 3. Cited in the Introduction to ''The Mimbres of the Mogollon culture: A people of mystery'' by Andrew Gulliford</ref><!-- Wooden grave-markers topped by animals have survived in small numbers from various locations from [[Florida]] to the Pacific North-West.-->

Some of the [[Mound builder (people)|North American mounds]], such as [[Grave Creek Mound]] (c. 250–150 BCE) in [[West Virginia]], functioned as burial sites, while others had different purposes.<ref>[http://www.wvculture.org/history/mounds.html Mounds & Mound Builders]Accessed April 25, 2010</ref>

==Traditional societies==
[[Image:Burial Site 2.jpg|thumb|left|A stone-carved [[Toraja]] cliff burial site. ''Tau tau'' (effigies of the deceased) look out over the land.]]
There is an enormous diversity of funeral art from traditional societies across the world, much of it in perishable materials, and some is mentioned elsewhere in the article.  In traditional African societies, [[African traditional masks|masks]] often have a specific association with death, and some types may be worn mainly or exclusively for funeral ceremonies.<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qmvR2YVCtLEC&pg=PA133&dq=African+death+dance+mask&as_brr=3&ei=rG3PS5b2Jo3KzgSs-9WEAw&cd=3#v=onepage&q=African%20death%20dance%20mask&f=false Masks in West African Traditional Societies], Bonnefoy, pp. 133–137</ref> The funeral ceremonies of the [[Indigenous Australians]] typically feature [[body painting]]; the [[Yolngu]] and [[Tiwi people|Tiwi]] people create carved ''[[pukumani]]'' burial poles from [[ironwood]] trunks,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3622670/Viewfinder-Aboriginal-burial-poles.html|title=Viewfinder: Aboriginal burial poles|last=Davies|first=Serena|date=23 August 2004|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=21 April 2010}}</ref> while elaborately carved [[burial tree]]s have been used in south-eastern Australia.<ref>Oxenham.</ref>  The [[Toraja]] people of central [[Sulawesi]] are famous for [[Toraja#Funeral_rites|their burial practices]], which include the setting-up of effigies of the dead on cliffs.  The 19th and 20th century royal [[Kasubi Tombs]] in [[Uganda]], destroyed by fire in 2010, were a circular compound of thatched buildings similar to those inhabited by the earlier [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]]s when alive, but with special characteristics.<ref>[http://www.kasubitombs.org/en/description/index.php Kasubi tombs website]</ref>

In several cultures, goods for use in the afterlife are still interred or cremated, for example [[Hell bank note]]s (and now credit cards) in Chinese communities.  In parts of Africa, elaborate figurative coffins in the shape of cars, boats or animals are made of [[papier-mache]] or other materials.<ref>[http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aoa/c/eagle_shaped_coffin.aspx British Museum: Modern coffin in the shape of an eagle], from [[Ghana]].

==Funerary art and religion==
===Buddhism===
Buddhist tombs themselves are typically simple and modest, although they may be set within temples, sometimes large complexes, built for the purpose in the then-prevailing style.  According to tradition, the remains of the [[Buddha]]'s body after [[cremation]] were entirely divided up into relics (''[[cetiya]]''), which played an important part in early Buddhism.  The ''[[stupa]]'' developed as a monument enclosing deposits of relics of the Buddha from plain hemispherical mounds in the 3rd century BCE to elaborate structures such as those at [[Sanchi]] in India and [[Borobudur]] in [[Java]].  Regional variants such as the [[pagoda]] of China and Japan and the [[candi of Indonesia]] evolved from the Indian form.  However, none of these can strictly be called tombs.<ref>Le Phuoc, 140–142; 147–156 on Sanchi; 192–204, especially 196, on ''candi'' in Indonesia, and Borodudur (196–204)</ref> Some important [[Tibet]]an [[lama]]s are buried in relatively small ''chortens'' (Tibetan stupas), sometimes of precious metal, inside or outside monasteries, sometimes after mummification. There are examples at [[Kursha Monastery]] in [[Zanskar]] and [[Tashiding Monastery]] in [[Sikkim]], as well as the [[Potala Palace]] in [[Lhasa]] and many other monasteries.<ref>Dowman, 54–55 for the Potala, and see index for other locations.</ref>  However, most chortens do not function as tombs.

=== Christianity ===
[[Image:1054 - Roma, Museo d. civiltà Romana - Calco sarcofago Giunio Basso - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 12-Apr-2008.jpg|thumb|left|Plaster cast of the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]]]]
The [[Catacombs of Rome]] contain most of the surviving [[Christian art]] of the [[Early Christianity|Early Christian]] period, mainly in the form of [[fresco]]s and [[Early Christian sarcophagi|sculpted sarcophagi]]. They show a Christian [[iconography]] emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art, but later borrowing from official imperial and pagan motifs.  Initially, Christians avoided iconic images of religious figures, and sarcophagi were decorated with ornaments, Christian symbols like the [[Chi Rho]] monogram and, later, narrative religious scenes.<ref>Syndicus, Chapter 1; Hall, 77–82</ref> The Early Christians' habit, after the end of their persecution, of building churches (most famously [[St Peter's, Rome]]) over the burial places of [[martyr]]s who had originally been buried discreetly or in a mass grave perhaps led to the most distinctive feature of Christian funerary art, the church monument, or tomb inside a church.<ref>Syndicus, 39, 72–90</ref> The beliefs of many cultures, including [[Tumah|Judaism]] and [[Hinduism]] as well as classical paganism, consider the dead [[Ritual purification|ritually impure]] and avoid mixing temples and cemeteries (though see above for Moche, and below for Islamic culture).<ref>Toynbee, 48–49. An exception in the Classical World were the [[Lycia]]ns of [[Anatolia]]. There are also the Egyptian mortuary-temples, where the object of worship was the deified royal person entombed, but Egyptian temples to the major gods contained no burials. For an extreme example, see [[Prohibition of death#In antiquity|ancient Delos]].</ref>  
[[Image:Venezia - Chiesa dei SS. Giovanni e Paolo (S. Zanipolo) - Foto G. Dall'Orto 2 lug 2006 - 08.jpg|thumb|Medieval and Renaissance wall tombs in [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice]], including an [[equestrian statue]] at the left]]

Christians believed in a bodily [[resurrection of the dead]] at the [[Second Coming of Christ]], and the Catholic Church only relaxed [[Cremation#Roman_Catholicism|its opposition to cremation]] in 1963.<ref>It was allowed in times of plague however. See [[Cremation in the Christian World]] for more details—the [[Orthodox church]]s still forbid cremation.</ref> Although mass [[ossuaries]] have also been used, burial has always been the preferred Christian tradition, at least until recent times. Burial was, for as long as there was room, usually in a graveyard adjacent to the church, with a gravestone or horizontal slab, or for the wealthy or important clergy, inside it. Wall tombs in churches strictly include the body itself, often in a sarcophagus, while often the body is buried in a [[crypt]] or under the church floor, with a monument on the wall. Persons of importance, especially monarchs, might be buried in a free-standing sarcophagus, perhaps surrounded by an elaborate enclosure using metalwork and sculpture; grandest of all were the [[shrine]]s of saints, which became the destinations of [[pilgrimage]]s. The monument to [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]] in the [[Hofkirche, Innsbruck]] took decades to complete,<ref>Board of Trustees for The Hofkirche in Innsbruck.</ref> while the [[Arca di San Domenico|tomb of Saint Dominic]] in [[Bologna]] took several centuries to reach its final form.<ref>Welch, 26</ref>

If only because its strong prejudice against free-standing and life-size sculpture, [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] could not have developed the tomb monument in the same way as the Western Church, and the burials of rich or important individuals continued the classical tradition of sarcophagi carved in relief, with the richness of the carving tending to diminish over the centuries, until just simple religious symbols were left.  [[Constantine I]] and most later [[Byzantine Emperor]]s up to 1028 were buried in the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] in Constantinople, which was destroyed after the [[fall of Constantinople]] of 1453.  Some massive but mostly plain [[porphyry]] sarcophagi from the church are now placed outside the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]].<ref>Downey.</ref>

The [[Tomb of Antipope John XXIII]] in [[Florence]] is a grand [[Early Renaissance]] wall tomb by [[Donatello]] and [[Michelozzo]]; although classical in style, it reflects the somewhat inharmonious stacking up of different elements typical of major Gothic tombs.  It has a life-size effigy lying on the sarcophagus, which was common from the Romanesque period through to the [[Baroque]] and beyond.<ref>Levey 1967, 57–59</ref>  Ruling dynasties were often buried together, usually in monasteries; the [[Chartreuse de Champmol]] was founded for that purpose by the [[House of Valois|Valois]] [[Duke of Burgundy|Dukes of Burgundy]] in 1383.  The [[Scaliger tombs]] in [[Verona]] are magnificent free-standing [[Gothic art|Gothic]] canopied tombs—they are outside the church in a special enclosure, and so are unrestricted in height.<ref>Though they are exceeded in scale by [[Gothic revival]] monuments like the [[Albert Memorial]] and the [[Scott Monument]], neither containing a tomb.</ref> Important churches like Saint Peter's in Rome, [[Saint Paul's Cathedral, London]], [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice]] (twenty-five [[Doge]]s), and the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence]] contain large numbers of impressive monuments to the great and the good, created by the finest architects and sculptors available.  Local [[parish church]]es are also often full of monuments, which may include large and artistically significant ones for local landowners and notables.  Often a prominent family would add a special chapel for their use, including their tombs; in Catholic countries, bequests would pay for [[Catholic mass|masses]] to be said in perpetuity for their souls.  By the [[High Renaissance]], led by [[Michelangelo]]'s tombs, the effigies are often sitting up, and later may stand.  Often they turn towards the altar, or are kneeling facing it in profile.<ref>Hall, 325</ref>

In the center of the rectangle is a circle representing a mirror, and within the circle is a grinning skull. The circle is framed by ram's horns.]]
In the late Middle Ages, influenced by the [[Black Death]] and devotional writers, explicit ''[[memento mori]]'' imagery of death in the forms of skulls or skeletons, or even decomposing corpses overrun with worms in the ''[[transi]]'' tomb, became common in northern Europe, and may be found in some funerary art, as well as motifs like the [[Danse Macabre|Dance of Death]] and works like the ''[[Ars moriendi]]'', or ""Art of Dying"".<ref>Cohen throughout, see Introduction</ref>  It took until the Baroque period for such imagery to become popular in Italy, in works like the tomb of [[Pope Urban VIII]] by [[Bernini]] (1628–47), where a bronze winged skeleton inscribes the Pope's name on a tablet below his enthroned effigy.<ref>Hall, 324–26</ref>

The church struggled to eliminate the pagan habits of leaving grave goods except for the clothing and usual jewellry of the powerful, especially rings.  Kings might be buried with a [[sceptre]], and bishops with a [[crozier]], their respective symbols of office.<ref>Piponnier & Mane, 112–113</ref>  The 7th century [[Stonyhurst Gospel]], with a unique [[Insular art|Insular]] original leather binding, was recovered from [[St Cuthbert's coffin]], itself a significant object; it was probably Cuthbert's personal copy, which he had very likely scribed himself.<ref>Bloxham, Jim & Rose, Krisine; [http://www.gbwny.org/news/2007/11/st-cuthbert-gospel-of-st-john-formerly-known-as-the-stonyhurst-gospel/ ''St. Cuthbert Gospel of St. John, Formerly Known as the Stonyhurst Gospel'']</ref>  The armour and sword of a knight might be hung over his tomb, as those of [[Edward, the Black Prince|the Black Prince]] still are in [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. The Early Christian Church, to the frustration of historians of costume, encouraged burial in a plain white [[winding-sheet]], as being all that would be required at the Second Coming.  For centuries, most except royalty followed this custom, which at least kept clothing, which was very expensive for rich and poor alike, available for the use of the living.  The use of a rich cloth [[Pall (funeral)|pall]] to cover the coffin during the funeral grew during the Middle Ages; initially these were brightly coloured and patterned, only later black.  They were usually then given to the Church to use for [[vestment]]s or other decorations.<ref>Piponnier & Mane, 34–35; 112–113</ref>   

From the early 13th century to the 16th, a popular form of monument north of the Alps, especially for the smaller landowner and merchant classes, was the [[monumental brass]], a sheet of brass on which the image of the person or persons commemorated was engraved, often with inscriptions and an architectural surround.  They could be on the floor or wall inside a church. These provide valuable evidence as to changes in costume, especially for women.  Many bishops and even some German rulers were commemorated with brasses.<ref>""Brasses, Monumental""</ref>
 
[[File:Pompe funebre for Katarzyna Opalińska.jpg|thumb|''[[Castrum doloris]]'' for a Queen of Poland, erected in [[Notre Dame de Paris]] in 1747]]
The ''[[castrum doloris]]'' was a temporary [[catafalque]] erected around the coffin for the [[lying in state]] of important people, usually in a church, the funerary version of the elaborate temporary decorations for other court festivities, like [[royal entries]].  These began in the late Middle Ages, but reached their height of elaboration in the 18th century.<ref>The corpse was in fact not always present. Bagliani, 158–159</ref> A particular feature in Poland was the [[coffin portrait]], a bust-length painted portrait of the deceased, attached to the coffin, but removed before burial and often then hung in the church.  Elsewhere, death masks were used in similar fashion.  [[Hatchment]]s were a special lozenge-shaped painted [[coat of arms]] which was displayed on the house of the deceased for a mourning period, before usually being moved to hang in the church.  Like [[mourning|mourning clothes]], these fall outside a strict definition of art.<ref>Piponnier & Mane, 113 for the origins of mourning clothes.</ref>

For some time after the [[Protestant Reformation]], [[English church monuments]] formed the majority of large-scale artworks added to Protestant churches, especially in sculpture.  The English upper classes ceased to commission altarpieces and other religious art for churches, but their tomb monuments continued to grow in size to fill the empty wall spaces; similar trends were seen in [[Lutheran]] countries, but [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] tended to be more disapproving of figure sculpture.<ref>See for example Michalski, xi. Here Michalski refers to this rejection of religious imagery within Calvinism as ""iconophobia"". See also Gäbler, 72,76–77 and Potter, 130–131 regarding the religious disputations in Zürich (1523) concerning (among other things) the removal of statues of saints and other icons. Participants included [[Leo Jud]] and [[Huldrych Zwingli]].</ref> Many portraits were painted after death, and sometimes dead family members were included along with the living; a variety of indications might be used to suggest the distinction.<ref>The [http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=3821 ''Saltonstall Family''] is a well-known example. The [[Arnolfini Portrait]] has been claimed to be such a work</ref> 

The large [[Baroque]] tomb monument continued likely to include a portrait of the deceased, and was more likely to include personified figures of Death, Time, Virtues or other figures than angels.  The late medieval [[transi]] tomb vocabulary of images of bodily decay, such as skulls and skeletons, was sometimes re-introduced, but in a less confrontational manner.<ref>Hall, 324–327</ref>  [[Neo-Classicism]], led by [[Antonio Canova]], revived the classical ''stela'', either with a portrait or a personification; in this style there was little or no difference between the demands of Catholic and Protestant patrons.<ref>Hall, 347–349; Berresford, 36–38</ref>

The street is lined with above-ground tombs, and a number of trees appear in the background.]]

By the 19th century, many [[Old World]] churchyards and church walls had completely run out of room for new monuments, and cemeteries on the outskirts of cities, towns or villages became the usual place for burials.<ref>""Cemetery""</ref>  The rich developed the classical styles of the ancient world for small family tombs, while the rest continued to use gravestones or what were now usually false sarcophagi, placed over a buried coffin.  The cemeteries of the large Italian cities are generally accepted to have outdone those of other nations in terms of extravagant statuary, especially the [[Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno]] in [[Genoa]], the [[Cimitero Monumentale di Milano]] and the [[Certosa di Bologna]].<ref>Berresford, throughout, and Prefaces</ref>  In Italy at least, funerary sculpture remained of equal status to other types during the 19th and early 20th centuries, and was made by the leading artists, often receiving reviews in the press, and being exhibited, perhaps in [[maquette]] form.<ref>Berresford, 13, and 58 on exhibitions</ref>  Monuments kept up with contemporary stylistic developments during the 19th century, embracing [[Symbolism]] enthusiatically, but then gradually became detached from the [[avant-garde]] after [[Art Nouveau]] and a few [[Art Deco]] examples.<ref>Berresford, 77–78 on ""Liberty"" (Italian term for ""Art Nouveau"") and 99–104 on Art Deco.</ref>  Where burials in church crypts or floors took place, memorial [[stained glass]] windows, mostly on normal religious subjects but with a commemorative panel, are often found.  [[War memorial]]s, other than on the site of a battle, were relatively unusual until the 19th century, but became increasingly common during it, and after [[World War I]] were erected even in villages of the main combatant nations.<ref>Mosse, Chapter 5</ref>

=== Islam ===
Islamic funerary art is dominated by [[architecture]].  Grave goods are discouraged to the point that their absence is frequently one recognition criterion of Muslim burials.<ref>Insoll, 172</ref> Royalty and important religious figures were typically buried in plain stone sarcophagi, perhaps with a religious inscription.  However, funerary architecture often offered a means of ""moving beyond the strictures of formal Muslim burial rites"" and expressing social dimensions such as status, piety, love for the deceased, and Muslim identity.<ref>Insoll, 177–180</ref> A number of distinct architectural traditions arose for expressing these social elements.  The Islamic tradition was slow in starting; the ''[[hadith]]'' ""condemn the building of tombs, and [[Muhammed]] himself set the example of requesting burial in an unmarked grave in one of the chambers of his house"" in [[Medina]],<ref>Ruggles, 103</ref> though by at least the 12th century, buildings of the vast [[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi]] complex already marked the site.  The earliest identified Muslim monumental tomb, in [[Samarra]] in Iraq, only dates from 862, and was commissioned by the Byzantine princess whose son was buried there.<ref>Ruggles, 103–104</ref>  At some point, the tradition incorporated the idea of a garden setting, perhaps following the Islamic concept of [[Paradise]], an association certainly made when the tradition was mature, although the difficulty of reconstructing gardens from archaeology makes the early stages of this process hard to trace.  At any rate, gardens surrounding tombs became established in Islamic tradition in many parts of the world, and existing pleasure gardens were sometimes appropriated for this purpose.  Versions of the formal Persian ''[[charbagh]]'' design were widely used in India, Persia and elsewhere.<ref>Ruggles, Chapter 9</ref>

Another influence may have been the octagonal [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]], not a mausoleum itself, but ""the earliest Islamic model for centrally-planned commemorative buildings"", adapting the Byzantine form of the martyrium in a building standing alone, though on a stone platform rather than in a garden.<ref>Ruggles, 104</ref>  In the [[Persianate society|Persian sphere]], a tradition of relatively small mausoleums evolved, often in the shape of short hexagonal or octagonal [[dome]]d towers, usually containing a single chamber, like the [[Malek Tomb]].  These single-chambered tombs developed into larger buildings in the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Empires,<ref name=""Insoll, 177"">Insoll, 177</ref> like the [[Gur-e Amir]] tomb of [[Timur]] at [[Samarkand]] and the famous Mughal tombs of India, which culminated in the [[Taj Mahal]]. The Mughal tombs are mostly set in a large walled ''charbagh'' (''chahar-bagh'') or [[Mughal gardens]], often with [[Pavilion (structure)|pavilion]]s at the corners<ref name=""Insoll, 177""/> and a gatehouse. The Taj Mahal is atypically placed at the end of the garden, backing onto the river [[Yamuna]]; a central placing is usual.<ref>Ruggles, 112 and 122. Her Chapter 10 includes a detailed description of the Taj with special reference to its gardens.</ref>  They may have [[minaret]]s, although they do not normally function as [[mosque]]s.  The [[Tomb of Jahangir]] lacks any dome,<ref>An interesting contrast with the Taj Mahal, given they were both built by [[Shah Jahan]].</ref> while the [[Tomb of Akbar the Great]] has only small decorative ones.  Other Islamic Indian rulers built similar tombs, of which the [[Gol Gumbaz]] is perhaps the most remarkable.

In all this tradition, the contemporary architectural style for mosques was adapted for a building with a smaller main room, and usually no courtyard.  Decoration was often tilework, and could include ''[[pietre dure|parchin kari]]'' inlays in semi-precious stone, painting, and decorative carving.  The sarcophagus might be in a small inner chamber, dimly visible through a grille of metal or stone, or might stand in the main room.  Money would be bequeathed to pay for continuous readings of the [[Qur'an]] in the mausoleum, and they were normally open for visitors to pay their respects. The [[Mausoleum of Khomeini]], still under construction in a [[Tehran]] cemetery, and intended to be the centre of a huge complex, continues these traditions.<ref name=""NYT K"">The New York Times, [http://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/08/world/khomeini-s-tomb-attracts-pilgrims.html ''Khomeini's Tomb Attracts Pilgrims''], Philip Shenon, Published: July 8, 1990, accessed April 25, 2010.</ref>  

The tradition evolved differently in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] world, where smaller single-roomed ''[[türbe]]'' typically stand on the grounds of mosque complexes, often built by the deceased.  The sarcophagi (often purely symbolic, as the body is below the floor) may be draped in a rich pall, and surmounted by a real cloth or stone [[turban]], which is also traditional at the top of ordinary [[Turkish people|Turkish]] gravestones (usually in stylised form). Two of the most famous are in the [[Süleymaniye Mosque]] in [[Istanbul]]; the [[Yeşil Türbe]] (""Green Tomb"") of 1421 is an unusually large example in [[Bursa]], and also unusual in having extensive tile work on the exterior, which is usually masonry, whereas the interiors are often decorated with brightly-colored tiles.<ref>Levey 1975, 29–33 on Bursa, 83–84 on Istanbul; all the leading Ottoman tombs are covered in the book.</ref>

Other parts of the Islamic world reflected local techniques and traditions.  The 15th century royal [[Tomb of Askia]] in [[Mali]] used the local technique of mud-building to erect a 17 metre high pyramidal tomb set in a mosque complex.<ref>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1139 Tomb of Askia], [[UNESCO]] page with aerial view.</ref>  At the other end of the Islamic world, [[Java]]nese royalty are mostly buried in royal graveyards such as those at [[Kota Gede]] and [[Imogiri]]. 

In the Arab world, mausoleums of rulers are more likely to be a side-room inside a mosque or form part of a larger complex containing perhaps a hospital, ''[[madrasa]]'' or library. Large domes, elaborately decorated inside, are common.  The tomb-mosque of Sultan [[Qaitbay]] (died 1496) is a famous example, one of many in [[Cairo]], though here the tomb chamber is unusually large compared to the whole.<ref>See Fletcher & Cruickshank, 596. The [[madrassa]] is labeled ""the ultimate achievement of architectural development in Cairo"" and its tomb chamber described as ""immense.""</ref>

==Modern period==
[[Image:Rachel whitereadwien holocaust mahnmal wien judenplatz.jpg|thumb|The [[Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial]] to the 65,000 Austrian Jews killed in the [[Holocaust]], designed by [[Rachel Whiteread]] and completed in 2000.]]
Funerary art tends to be conservative in style, and many grave markers in various cultures follow rather traditional patterns, while others reflect [[modernism]] or other recent styles.  Public monuments to the dead continue to be erected, especially [[war memorials]]. Some are fairly traditional, while those reflecting more contemporary styles include the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]], and several [[Holocaust memorials]], such as [[Yad Vashem]] in Jerusalem, the [[Vel%27_d%27Hiv_Roundup#Memorials_and_monuments_-_Paris|Vel d'Hiv Memorial]] in [[Paris]] (1994), the [[Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe]] in Berlin (2004), and the [[Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial]] in Vienna (2000). These are in notable contrast to the style of most war memorials to the military of World War II; earlier modernist memorials to the dead of World War I were sometimes removed after a time as inappropriate.<ref>Mosse, 103–106 on conservatism, and generally throughout Chapter 5 on war memorials.</ref>  Some war memorials, especially in countries like Germany, have had a turbulent political history, for example the much-rededicated [[Neue Wache]] in Berlin.<ref>Mosse, 97–98; Carrier, 201</ref> Several critics detect a crisis in public memorial style from 1945, when the traditional figurative symbolic language, and evocation of nationalist values, came to seem inadequate, especially in relation to [[genocide]], at least on the Western side of the [[Iron Curtain]].<ref>Carrier, 19–22; Benton throughout, especially p. 194.</ref> In the [[Communist]] East the established style of [[Socialist Realism]] was still considered appropriate, at least by the authorities.<ref>Benton throughout, especially Chapter 1 on Soviet War Memorials (pp. 12–13 on Socialist Realism), but also noting deviations in the Warsaw Pact satellites, as on p. 194, and Chapter 7 on West Germany.</ref> The generation of abstracted and [[Conceptual art|conceptual]] war and [[Holocaust]] memorials erected in the West from the 1990s onwards seems finally to have found a resolution for these issues.<ref>Carrier, throughout, especially Chapter 8.  See also the copious literature on the Washington Vietnam Veterans Memorial.</ref>     

Many large mausoleums have been constructed for political leaders, including [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] and those for [[Anıtkabir|Atatürk]], [[Mazar-e-Quaid|Jinnah]], [[Kumsusan Memorial Palace|Kim Il-Sung]], [[Mausoleo Che Guevara|Che Guevara]] and several [[Presidential memorials in the United States]].  The Mausoleum of Khomeini is a grand mosque complex, as large as any medieval example, not least because it includes a 20,000 place parking lot.<ref name=""NYT K""/>

{{Campaignbox Polish-Bolshevik War}}

The '''Battle of Warsaw''' (sometimes referred to as the '''Miracle at the Vistula''', [[Polish language|Polish]]: ''Cud nad Wisłą'') was the decisive [[battle]] of the [[Polish-Soviet War]], which began soon after the end of [[World War I]] in 1918 and lasting until the [[Treaty of Riga]] (1921).

The Battle of Warsaw was fought from 13 to 25 August 1920 as [[Red Army]] forces commanded by [[Mikhail Tukhachevski]] approached the [[Poland|Polish]] [[capital]] of [[Warsaw]] and nearby [[Modlin Fortress]]. On [[August 16]], [[Poland|Polish]] forces commanded by [[Józef Piłsudski]] [[counter-attack]]ed from the south, forcing the [[Russia]]n forces into a disorganised [[withdrawal (military)|withdrawal]] eastward and behind the [[Niemen River]]. Estimated [[Bolshevik]] losses were 10,000 killed, 500 missing, 10,000 wounded and 66,000 [[prisoner of war|taken prisoner]], compared with Polish losses of some 4,500 killed, 10,000 missing and 22,000 wounded.

Before the Polish victory at the [[Vistula]], both the Bolsheviks and the majority of foreign experts considered Poland to be on the verge of defeat. The stunning, unexpected Polish victory crippled the Bolshevik forces. In the following months, several more Polish victories secured Poland's independence and eastern borders.

==The battle==
===Prelude to the battle===
The Poles were fighting to preserve their [[History of Poland (1918–1939)|newly regained independence]], lost in the 1795 [[partitions of Poland|third partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and to carve out the borders of a new multinational federation ([[Międzymorze]]) from the territories of their former partitioners, [[Russia]], [[Germany]] and the [[Austria-Hungary]].<ref name=""Dparker"">[[David Parker]], ''The Tragedy of Great Power Politics'', W. W. Norton & Company, 2001, ISBN 0-393-02025-8, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0393020258&id=9kg3geTnQ0wC&pg=PA194&lpg=PA194&dq=Whites+%22early+1920%22&sig=Qde1h5U-2x8qaCoVbX8iQSo7fcE Google Print, p.194]</ref>

The Bolsheviks had in 1919 gained the upper hand in the [[Russian Civil War]], having dealt crippling blows to the [[White Russians]].<ref name=""Dparker""/> [[Vladimir Lenin]] viewed Poland as a bridge that had to be crossed so that communism could be brought to [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Western Europe]], and the [[Polish-Bolshevik War]] seemed the perfect way to test Bolshevik strength. Bolshevik speeches asserted that the revolution was to be carried to western Europe on the [[bayonet]]s of Soviet ''soldat''s and that the shortest route to [[Berlin]] and [[Paris]] lay through Warsaw. <ref name=""Davies_WERS-29"">[[Norman Davies|Davies, Norman]], ''White Eagle, Red Star: the Polish-Soviet War, 1919–20'', Pimlico, 2003, ISBN 0-7126-0694-7. (First edition: New York, St. Martin's Press, inc., 1972.) Page 29</ref>

After early setbacks against Poland in 1919, the Bolshevik offensive that eclipsed the Polish [[Kiev Operation]] began in early 1920 and had been overwhelmingly successful. By mid-1920, Poland's very survival was at stake and the entire world expected Poland to collapse at any moment.<ref name=""Lukowski"">[[Jerzy Lukowski]], [[Hubert Zawadzki]], ''A Concise History of Poland'', Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0-521-55917-0, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521559170&id=NpMxTvBuWHYC&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203&dq=Polish+independence+1920&sig=UPANmW8JC1oZuaBL6mx2o-6xExw Google Print, p.203]</ref> The Soviet strategy called for a massed push toward the Polish capital, Warsaw. Its capture would have had a tremendous [[propaganda]] effect for the Soviets, who expected it not only to undermine the morale of the Poles, but to spark an international series of communist uprisings and clear the way for the Red Army to join the [[German Revolution]].
[[Image:Polish-soviet_war_1920_Polish_defences_near_Milosna,_August.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Polish defences at Miłosna, near Warsaw.]]

The Soviet [[1st Cavalry Army]] under [[Semyon Budyonny]] broke through Polish lines in early June 1920.<ref name=""Lawrynowicz"">[http://www.hetmanusa.org/engarticle1.html Battle Of Warsaw 1920 by Witold Lawrynowicz; A detailed write-up, with bibliography]. Last accessed on 5 November 2006.</ref> This led to a collapse of all Polish [[Front (military)|fronts]] in the east. On [[July 4]], [[1920]], [[Mikhail Tukhachevski]]'s [[Front (Soviet Army)|Western Front]] began an all-out assault in [[Belarus]] from the [[Berezina River]], forcing Polish forces to [[Withdrawal (military)|retreat]]. On [[July 19]] the [[Red Army]] seized [[Grodno]], on [[July 28]], it reached [[Białystok]], and three days later, the [[Brest-Litovsk|Brześć Fortress]] was captured.<ref name=""Lawrynowicz""/><ref name=""Szczep""/>

===The battle plan===
====Polish plan====
[[Image:Jozef_Pilsudski1.jpg|thumb|right|100|Polish commander: Józef Piłsudski.]]
By the beginning of August, the Polish retreat had become more organized. At first, [[Józef Piłsudski]] wanted to base his operation on the [[Western Bug|Bug River]] and [[Brest-Litovsk]], but their unexpected fall made it impossible.<ref name=""Lawrynowicz""/> On the night of August 5—6, Piłsudski conceived a revised plan at the [[Belweder|Belweder Palace]] in Warsaw. It called in the first phase for Polish forces to withdraw across the Vistula River and defend the bridgeheads at [[Warsaw]] and at the [[Wieprz River]]. Some 25% of the available [[division (military)|divisions]] would be concentrated to the south for a strategic counteroffensive. Next, Piłsudski's plan called for the 1st and 2nd Armies of Gen. [[Józef Haller de Hallenburg|Józef Haller's]] Central Front (10 1/2 divisions) to take a passive role, facing the Soviet frontal attack on Warsaw from the east and holding their [[trench|entrenched]] positions at all costs. At the same time, the 5th Army (5 1/2 divisions) under Gen. [[Władysław Sikorski]], subordinate to Gen. Haller, would defend the northern area near the [[Modlin Fortress]] and, when it became feasible, strike from behind Warsaw, thus cutting off Soviet forces attempting to envelop Warsaw from that direction, and break through the enemy front and fall upon the rear of the Soviet Northwestern Front. An additional five divisions of the 5th Army were to defend Warsaw from the north. General [[Franciszek Latinik]]'s 1st Army would defend Warsaw itself, while General [[Bolesław Roja]]'s 2nd Army was to hold the Vistula River line from [[Góra Kalwaria]] to [[Dęblin]].<ref name=""Lawrynowicz""/><ref name=""Szczep""/>

The most important role, however, was assigned to a relatively small (some 20,000-man), newly assembled ""Reserve Army"" (also called the ""Assault Group"" - ''Grupa Uderzeniowa''), commanded personally by Józef Piłsudski, comprising the most battle-hardened and determined Polish units drawn from the southern front. They were to be reinforced by General [[Leonard Skierski]]'s 4th Army and General [[Zygmunt Zieliński]]'s 3rd Army, which, after retreating from the [[Western Bug River]] area, had moved not directly toward Warsaw but had crossed the [[Wieprz River]] and broken off contact with their pursuers. The Assault Group's assignment was to spearhead a lightning northern offensive from the Vistula-Wieprz River triangle south of Warsaw, through a weak spot identified by Polish intelligence between the Soviet Western and Southwestern Fronts. This would separate the Soviet Western Front from its reserves and disorganize its movements. Eventually the gap between Gen. Sikorski's 5th Army and the advancing Assault Group would close near the East Prussian border, leaving the Soviet offensive ""trapped in a sack.""<ref name=""Szczep""/>

Although based on fairly reliable information provided by Polish intelligence and intercepted Soviet [[radio]] communications<ref name=""Ścieżyński"">{{pl icon}} [[Mieczysław Ścieżyński|Ścieżyński, Mieczysław]], [[Colonel of the (Polish) General Staff]], ''Radjotelegrafja jako źrodło wiadomości o nieprzyjacielu'' (Radiotelegraphy as a Source of Intelligence on the Enemy), Przemyśl, [[Printing and Binding Establishment of (Military) Corps District No. X HQ]], 1928, 49 pp.</ref><ref name=""Wroński"">{{pl icon}} [[Paweł Wroński]], ''""Sensacyjne odkrycie: Nie było cudu nad Wisłą""'' (""A Remarkable Discovery: There Was No Miracle at the Vistula""), ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]'', [http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,53600,2855976.html online].</ref><ref name=""Bury"">[[Jan Bury]], POLISH CODEBREAKING DURING THE RUSSO-POLISH WAR OF 1919-1920, [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3926/is_200407/ai_n9458625 online]</ref>, the plan was labelled as 'amateurish' by many high-ranking army officers and military experts, who were quick to point out Piłsudski's lack of formal military education. Many Polish units, a mere week before the planned date of the counter-attack, were fighting in places as far as 100-150 miles (150 to 250 km) from the concentration points. All of the troop movements were within striking distance of the Red Army. One strong push by the Red Army could derail plans for a Polish counter-attack and endanger the cohesion of the whole Polish front. Piłsudski's plan was strongly criticized by Polish commanders and officers of the [[French Military Mission to Poland|French Military Mission]]. Even Piłsudski himself admitted in his memoirs that it was a very risky gamble and the reasons he decided to go forward with the plan were the defeatist mood of politicians, fear for the safety of the capital and the prevailing feeling that if Warsaw were to fall, all would be lost. Only the desperate situation persuaded other army commanders to go along with it, as they realized that under such circumstances it was the only possible way to avoid a devastating defeat. Ironically, when a copy of the plan accidentally fell into Soviet hands it was considered to be a poor deception attempt and ignored.<ref name=""Szczep""/> A few days later, the Soviets paid dearly for this mistake.
[[Image:Tukhachevsky-mikhail-2.jpg|thumb|right|100|Soviet commander: Mikhail Tukhachevski.]]

There is some controversy as to the authorship of the plan.<ref name=""Szczep""/> Due to Piłsudski's political image, he was largely unpopular with the right wing of Polish politics. Because of that, after the battle many journalists suggested that the plan was in fact prepared either by [[Maxime Weygand]] or by the Polish Chief of Staff [[Tadeusz Rozwadowski]].<ref name=""Szczep""/> According to recent research<ref name=""Odziemkowski"">{{pl icon}} {{cite journal | author=[[Janusz Odziemkowski]] | title=""Wojna Polski z Rosją Sowiecką, 1919-1920"" (""Poland's War with Soviet Russia, 1919-1920"") | journal=Mówią Wieki (The Ages Speak) | year=2005 | volume=2/2005 | pages=46&ndash;58 }}</ref>, the [[French Military Mission to Poland]] proposed only a minor tactical counter-attack of two divisions towards [[Mińsk Mazowiecki]]. Its aim would have been to push the Bolshevik forces 30 kilometres back in order to ease subsequent ceasefire negotiations<ref name=""Wandycz"">{{en icon}} {{cite journal | author =[[Piotr Wandycz]] | year =1960 | month =January | title =General Weygand and the Battle of Warsaw of 1920 | journal =[[Journal of Central European Affairs]] | volume =XIX | issue =IV | pages =357-365 | id = | url = | format = | accessdate = }}</ref>. On the other hand, Gen. Rozwadowski's plan called for a deeper thrust into Russian lines from the area of Wieprz. However, Piłsudski proposed a large scale operation, with significant forces committed to beating the enemy forces rather than merely pushing them back. The plan was opposed by the French mission, which did not believe that the Polish Army would be able to regroup after a 600 kilometre retreat<ref name=""Musialik"">{{en icon}} {{cite book | author =Zdzisław Musialik | title =General Weygand and the Battle of the Vistula 1920 | year =1987 | pages =57 | publisher =[[Piłsudski Institute]] | location =London | id = | url = | format = | accessdate = }}</ref>. Nonetheless for many years, a [[mythology|myth]] persisted that it was the timely arrival of Allied forces that had saved Poland, a myth in which Weygand occupied the central role.<ref name=""Cienciala"">[http://www.ku.edu/~eceurope/hist557/lect11.htm THE REBIRTH OF POLAND].

====Bolshevik plan====
[[Mikhail Tukhachevski]] planned to encircle and surround [[Warsaw]] by crossing the [[Vistula]] river, near [[Włocławek]] to the north and south of the city and launch an attack from the northwest. With his 24 divisions, he planned to repeat the classic maneuvre of [[Ivan Paskievich]], who in 1831, during the [[November Uprising]], had crossed the [[Vistula]] at [[Toruń]] and reached Warsaw practically unopposed<ref name=""Erickson"">{{en icon}} {{cite book | author = | coauthors = | title =The Soviet High Command: a military-political history 1918-1941 | year =2001 | editor = | pages =84-90 | chapter =Before the Gates of Warsaw: 1920 | chapterurl =http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0714651788&id=rgkSxFpKmIsC&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&vq=Warsaw&dq=Warsaw+1920&sig=3ZjTdO849Z5fH4tcyC0Pi7nFP9M | publisher =Frank Cass | location = | id =ISBN 0-7146-5178-8 | url = }}</ref><ref name=""Lawrynowicz""/>. This move would also cut the Polish forces off from [[Gdańsk]], the only port open to shipments of arms and supplies.<ref name=""Szczep""/>

The main weakness of the Soviet plan was the poorly defended southern flank, secured only by the [[Pinsk Marshes]] and the weak [[Mozyr Group]]; the majority of the Soviet Southwest Front was engaged in the [[battle of Lwów (1920)]].<ref name=""Lawrynowicz""/>

===First phase, August 12===
Meanwhile Bolsheviks pushed forward. [[Gay Dimitrievich Gay]]'s Cavalry Corps together with the 4th Army crossed [[Wkra]] river and advanced towards the town of [[Włocławek]]. The 15th and 3rd Armies were approaching [[Modlin fortress]] and the 16th Army moved towards Warsaw.

The final Soviet assault on Warsaw began on August 12 with the Soviet 16th Army [[Battle of Radzymin (1920)|the attack at the town of Radzymin]] (only 23 kilometres east of the city). Its initial success prompted Piłsudski to move up his plans by 24 hours.
[[Image:Battle of Warsaw - Phase 1.png|thumb|200px|left|Positions prior to the battle.]]

The first phase of the battle started on [[August 13]], with a [[Red Army]] frontal assault on the [[Praga]] [[bridgehead]]. In heavy fighting, [[Radzymin]] changed hands several times and foreign [[diplomat]]s, with the exception of British and [[Holy See|Vatican]] ambassadors, hastily left Warsaw.<ref name=""Lawrynowicz""/> On [[August 14]], it fell to the [[Red Army]], and the lines of Gen. [[Władysław Sikorski]]'s Polish 5th Army were broken. The 5th Army had to fight three Soviet armies at once: the 3rd, 4th and 15th. The [[Modlin (village)|Modlin]] sector was reinforced with reserves (the ''[[Siberian Brigade]],'' and Gen. [[Franciszek Krajowski]]'s fresh ''18th Infantry Division''—both elite, battle-tested units), and the 5th Army held out until dawn.

The situation was saved around midnight when the ''203rd [[Uhlan]] Regiment'' managed to break through the Bolshevik lines and destroy the [[radio station]] of [[A.D. Shuvayev]]'s Soviet 4th Army. The latter unit had only one remaining radio station fixed on one frequency which was known to the Polish intelligence. Since the Polish code-breakers did not want the Bolsheviks to find out that their codes were broken, but still neutralize the other radio station, the radio station in Warsaw recited the book of [[Genesis]] in Polish and Latin on the frequency used by the 4th Army, which thus lost contact with its [[headquarters]] and continued marching toward [[Toruń]] and [[Płock]], unaware of [[Mikhail Tukhachevski|Tukhachevski's]] order to turn south. The raid by the 203rd Uhlans is sometimes referred to as ''the Miracle of [[Ciechanów]]''.<ref name=""Szczep""/>

At the same time, the Polish 1st Army under Gen. [[Franciszek Latinik]] resisted a Red Army direct assault on Warsaw by six [[rifle]] divisions. The struggle for control of Radzymin forced Gen. Józef Haller, commander of the Polish ''Northern Front'', to start the 5th Army's counterattack earlier than planned.<ref name=""Lawrynowicz""/>

During this time, Piłsudski was finishing his plans for the counter-offensive. He decided to personally supervise the attack and, because of the enormous risks involved, he handed in a letter with his resignation from all state functions. Thereafter, between August 13 and 15, he visited all units of the 4th Army concentrating near [[Puławy]], about 100 kilometres south of Warsaw. He tried to raise morale, since many soldiers were tired and demoralized and numerous recently incorporated replacements showed everyone the extent of Polish losses. Logistics were a nightmare, as the Polish army was equipped with guns made in five countries and rifles manufactured in six, each of them using different ammunition. Adding to the problem was the fact that the equipment was in poor shape. Piłsudski remembers: ""In 21 Division, almost half of the soldiers paraded in front of me barefoot."" Nevertheless, in only three days, Piłsudski was able to raise the morale of his troops and motivate them for one of their greatest efforts.<ref name=""Lawrynowicz""/>

===Second phase, August 14===
The 27th Infantry Division of the Red Army managed to reach the village of [[Izabelin]], 13 kilometres from the capital, but this was the closest that Russian forces would come. Soon the tides of battle would change.<ref name=""Lawrynowicz""/>
[[Image:Bitwa warszawska rano 15 lipca 600px.png|thumb|200px|right|Positions around Warsaw, early morning on [[August 15]].]]

Tukhachevski, certain that all was going according to plan, was actually falling into Piłsudski's trap. The Russian march across the Vistula in the north was striking into an operational vacuum, where there was no sizeable group of Polish troops. On the other hand, south of Warsaw, Tukhachevski left only token forces to guard the vital link between the North-Western and South-Western Fronts. The [[Mozyr]] Group, which was assigned this task, numbered only 8,000 soldiers. Another error neutralized the 1st Cavalry Army of [[Semyon Budyonny]], a unit much feared by Piłsudski and other Polish commanders. Soviet High Command, at Tukhachevski's insistence, ordered the 1st Cavalry Army to march toward Warsaw from the south. Semyon Budyonny did not obey this order due to a grudge between commanding South-Western Front generals [[Aleksandr Yegorov]] and Tukhachevski.<ref name=""Lawrynowicz""/> In addition, the political games of [[Joseph Stalin]] at the time the chief political [[commissar]] of the South-Western Front, further contributed to Yegorov's and Budyonny's disobedience.<ref name="" Adam Bruno Ulam"">''Stalin: The Man and His Era'', Beacon Press, 1987, ISBN 0-8070-7005-X, [http://books.google.com/books?id=A1eYKftgwgYC&pg=PA188&lpg=PA188&sig=_e0xasWyvPEw8iaZgY9EL8v_6yg Google Print, p.189]</ref> Stalin, in search of personal glory, wanted to capture the besieged important industrial center of [[Lwów]]. Ultimately, Budyonny's forces marched on Lwow instead of Warsaw and thus missed the battle.<ref name=""Lawrynowicz""/>

[[Image:Bitwa warszawska 15 lipca ok godz 13 600px.png|thumb|200px|right|Heavy fighting for [[Radzymin]], 13:00 hours, [[August 15]].]]
The Polish 5th Army counter-attacked on [[August 14]], crossing the [[Wkra]] River. It faced the combined forces of the Soviet 3rd and 15th Armies (both numerically and technically superior). The struggle at [[Nasielsk]] lasted until [[August 15]] and resulted in the almost complete destruction of the town. However, the Soviet advance toward Warsaw and Modlin was halted at the end of August 15th and on that day Polish forces recaptured Radzymin, which boosted the Polish morale.<ref name=""PWN:wojna"">{{pl icon}} [http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo.php?id=3997498 Wojna polsko-bolszewicka]. Entry at [[Internetowa encyklopedia PWN]]. Last accessed on 27 October 2006.</ref>

From that moment on, Gen. Sikorski's 5th Army pushed exhausted Soviet units away from Warsaw, in an almost [[blitzkrieg]]-like operation. Sikorski's units, supported by the majority of the small number of Polish [[tank]]s, [[armoured car]]s and [[artillery]] of the two [[armoured train]]s, advanced at the speed of 30 kilometres a day, soon destroying any Soviet hopes for completing their ""enveloping"" manoeuvre in the north.<ref name=""Szczep""/>

===Third phase, August 16===
On [[August 16]], the Polish ''Reserve Army'' commanded by Józef Piłsudski began its march north from the [[Wieprz]] River. It faced the ''[[Mozyr]] Group'', a Soviet corps that had defeated the Poles during the [[Kyiv]] operation several months earlier. However, during its pursuit of the retreating Polish armies, the ''Mozyr Group'' had lost most of its forces and been reduced to a mere two divisions covering a 150-kilometre front-line on the left flank of the Soviet 16th Army. On the first day of the counter-offensive, only one of the five Polish divisions reported any sort of opposition, while the remaining four, supported by a [[cavalry]] brigade, managed to push north 45 kilometres unopposed. When evening fell, the town of [[Włodawa]] had been liberated, and the communication and supply lines of the Soviet 16th Army had been cut. Even Piłsudski was surprised by the extent of these early successes. ''Reserve Army'' units covered about 70 kilometres in 36 hours, splitting the Soviet offensive and meeting virtually no resistance. The Mozyr Group consisted solely of the 57th Infantry Division, which had been beaten in the first day of the operation. Consequently, the Polish armies found a huge gap between the Russian fronts and exploited it, continuing their northward offensive with two armies following and falling on the surprised and confused enemy.<ref name=""Lawrynowicz""/><ref name=""PWN:wojna""/><ref name=""Szczep""/>

On August 18, [[Mikhail Tukhachevski]], in his headquarters in [[Minsk]] some 300 miles east of Warsaw, became fully aware of the extent of his defeat and ordered the remnants of his forces to retreat and regroup. His intention was to straighten the front line, stop the Polish attack and to regain the initiative, but the orders either arrived too late or failed to arrive at all. Soviet General [[Gay Dimitrievich Gay|Gay's]] 3rd Cavalry Corps continued to advance toward [[Pomerania]], its lines endangered by the Polish 5th Army, which had finally managed to push back the Bolshevik armies and gone over in pursuit. The Polish 1st Division of the Legion, in order to cut the enemy's retreat, made a remarkable march from [[Lubartów]] to [[Białystok]] - 163 miles in 6 days. The soldiers fought in two battles, slept only a few hours and marched for up to 21 hours a day. Their sacrifice and endurance was rewarded when the entire 16th Soviet Army was cut off at [[Białystok]] and most of its troops taken prisoner.<ref name=""Lawrynowicz""/>

The Soviet armies in the centre of the front fell into chaos. Some divisions continued to fight their way toward [[Warsaw]], while others turned to retreat, lost their cohesion and panicked<ref name=""Cisek"">{{en icon}} {{cite book | author =Janusz Cisek | coauthors = | title =Kosciuszko, We Are Here!: American Pilots of the Kosciuszko Squadron in Defense of Poland, 1919-1921 | year = | editor = | pages =141 | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =McFarland & Company | location = | id =ISBN 0-7864-1240-2 | url =http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0786412402&id=hNuGZOGk6UoC&pg=PA141&lpg=PA141&vq=panic&dq=Warsaw+1920&sig=G1_4J74xbPKYN6Qsd7YgIVM2UWY | format = | accessdate = }}</ref>. The Russian [[commander-in-chief]] lost contact with most of his forces, and all Soviet plans were thrown into disorder. Only the 15th Army remained an organised force and tried to obey Tukhachevski's orders, shielding the withdrawal of the westernmost extended 4th Army. But it was defeated twice on August 19th and 20th and joined the general rout of the Red Army's North-Western Front. Tukhachevski had no choice but to order a full [[retreat]] toward the Western [[Bug River]]. By August 21st, all organized resistance ceased to exist and by August 31, the Soviet South-Western Front was completely routed.<ref name=""Lawrynowicz""/><ref name=""PWN:wojna""/>

===Aftermath===
Although Poland managed to achieve victory and push back the Russians, Piłsudski's plan to outmanoeuvre and surround the Red Army did not succeed completely. Four Soviet armies began to march toward Warsaw on July 4th in the framework of the North-Western Front. By the end of August, the 4th and 15th Armies were defeated in the field, their remnants crossed the Prussian border and were disarmed. Nevertheless, these troops were soon released and fought against Poland again. The 3rd Army retreated east so quickly that Polish troops could not catch up with them; consequently, this army sustained the fewest losses. The 16th Army disintegrated at [[Białystok]] and most of its soldiers became prisoners of war. The majority of Gay's 3rd Cavalry Corps were forced across the German border and were temporarly interned in [[East Prussia]].<ref name=""Lawrynowicz""/>
[[Image:Polish-soviet_war_1920_Aftermath_of_Battle_of_Warsaw.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Polish soldiers displaying captured Soviet battle standards.]]

Soviet losses were about 10,000 dead, 500 missing, 10,000 wounded and 65,000 captured, compared to Polish losses of approximately 4,500 killed, 22,000 wounded and 10,000 missing. Between 25,000 and 30,000 Soviet troops managed to reach the borders of [[Germany]]. After crossing into East Prussia, they were briefly [[internment|interned]], then allowed to leave with their arms and equipment. Poland captured about 231 [[artillery]] guns and 1,023 [[machine-gun]]s.<ref name=""Lawrynowicz""/>

The southern arm of the [[Red Army]]'s forces had been routed and no longer posed a threat to the Poles. Semyon Budyonny's 1st Cavalry Army besieging [[Lwów]] had been defeated at the [[Battle of Komarów]] (August 31, 1920) and the [[Battle of Hrubieszów]]. By mid-October, the Polish Army had reached the [[Tarnopol]]-[[Dubno]]-[[Minsk]]-[[Drisa]] line.

Tukhachevski managed to reorganize the eastward-retreating forces and in September established a new defensive line near [[Grodno]]. In order to break it, the Polish Army had to fight the [[Battle of the Niemen River]] (September 15-September 21), once again defeating the Bolshevik armies. After the [[Battle of the Szczara River]], both sides were exhausted and on [[October 12]], under heavy pressure from [[France]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]], a [[cease-fire]] was signed. By [[October 18]], the fighting was over, and on [[March 18]], 1921, the [[Treaty of Riga]] was signed, ending hostilities.

Soviet [[propaganda]] before the Battle of Warsaw had described the fall of Poland's capital as imminent, and the anticipated fall of Warsaw was to be a signal for the start of a large-scale communist revolutions in Poland, Germany and other European countries, economically devastated by the [[World War I|First World War]]. The Soviet defeat was thus a setback for some Soviet officials (particularly [[Vladimir Lenin]]).

A [[National Democratic Party (Poland)|National Democrat]] [[Sejm]] deputy, [[Stanisław Stroński]], coined the phrase, ""Miracle at the Wisła"" ([[Polish language|Polish]]: ''""Cud nad Wisłą""''), to underline his disapproval of [[Józef Piłsudski|Piłsudski's]] ""Ukrainian adventure."" Stroński's phrase was adopted with approval by some patriotically- or piously-minded Poles unaware of Stroński's ironic intent.<ref name=""Szczep""/>

===Breaking of Soviet ciphers===
According to documents found in 2005 at Poland's Central Military Archives, [[Biuro Szyfrów|Polish cryptologists]] broke intercepted Russian ciphers as early as September 1919. At least some of the Polish victories, not only the Battle of Warsaw but throughout the campaign, are attributable to this. Lieutenant [[Jan Kowalewski]], credited with the original breakthrough, received the order of [[Virtuti Militari]] in 1921.<ref name=""Ścieżyński""/><ref name=""Wroński""/><ref name=""Bury""/>

[[Admiral of the Blue]] '''Sir Henry Digby''' [[Order of the Bath|GCB]] (20 January 1770&nbsp;– 19 August 1842) was a senior British naval officer, who served in the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]] in the [[Royal Navy]]. Born into a long established naval family, his uncle was the famous Admiral [[Robert Digby]], Henry went to sea at the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]] aged fourteen.

As a Lieutenant aboard [[HMS Pallas (1793)|HMS ''Pallas'']], he received a commendation for rescuing the crew of a [[HMS Boyne (1790)|burning ship]]. Promoted to Commander in August 1795 and Captain in December 1796, Digby established a reputation as an aggressive prize taker, capturing 57 ships in less than twenty months. His richest capture came in October 1799 when he assisted in the taking of the treasure ship, the Santa ''Brigida''. He commanded [[HMS Africa (1781)|HMS ''Africa'']] at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], manoeuvering her into the French and Spanish fleet against orders, having been instructed by [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] to avoid battle, fearing Digby's small [[ship of the line]] would be overwhelmed.

In 1806 Digby married Lady Jane Elizabeth Coke, daughter of [[Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (seventh creation)|Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester]] with whom he had three children. They moved to the estate in [[Dorset]] inherited from his uncle where the prize money amassed by Digby paid for a comfortable life. He continued to serve in the navy, was appointed [[Commander in Chief]], [[Sheerness]] and attained the rank of [[Admiral]] in 1841. 

==Early life==
The nephew of [[Robert Digby (Royal Navy officer)|Robert Digby]], Henry was born in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] on the 20 January 1770.<ref name=BB261>Broadly & Bartelot (1906) p.261</ref> His father, the Hon. Rev. William Digby, was the younger brother of the sixth [[Baron Digby]] and later became Dean of [[Durham]] and Chaplain Ordinary to [[King George III]].<ref name=HC51/> Henry was one of ten children and the oldest of four boys; two of whom, Charles George (1780) and Joseph (1786), also served in the [[Royal Navy]].<ref>Broadly & Bartelot (1906) pp.260-261</ref> The younger, Joseph, later becoming a Vice-Admiral. <ref name=BB261>Broadly & Bartelot (1906) p.261</ref> On the 2nd April 1783, Henry was entered onto the muster roll of HMS ''Jason'' then [[HMS Vestal (1779)|HMS ''Vestal'']] from the 1st May till the 6th March 1784 as a captain's servant. After a six week break, on the 16th April he was entered into the books of [[HMS Royal Charlotte|HMS ''Royal Charlotte'']] until the end of the year when he finally went to sea aboard the 50-gun [[HMS Europa (1783)|HMS ''Europa'']] and sailed for the [[West Indies]].<ref name=BB261/>

==Naval career==
Digby was to spend the next two and half years aboard the ''Europa''. He was almost immediately promoted from Captain's servant to [[Able seaman (rank)|Able Seaman]] and shortly after, to [[Midshipman]].<ref name=BB261/> On the 4th July 1787, after a brief return to England, he was appointed, first to the [[HMS Janus (1778)|''Janus'']] and then the [[HMS Salisbury (1769)|''Salisbury'']] on the [[North America and West Indies Station|North American station]].<ref name=BB261/> Digby's father died in November 1788 and he returned home but by December he was aboard the sloop [[HMS Racehorse (1781)|''Racehorse'']] trying to stop the smuggling trade in the [[North Sea]]. He returned to England once more on the 22nd September 1789 and did not go to sea again until the following August during which time he passed his lieutenant's exam.<ref name=BB262>Broadley and Bartelot (1906) p.262</ref> After a short probationary period aboard [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|HMS ''Bellerophon'']], he was confirmed as Fourth Lieutenant of the [[HMS Lion (1777)|''Lion'']] in October 1790. <ref name=BB262/><ref name=HC51>Heathcote (2005) p.51</ref> Returning from the West Indies in September 1791, Digby spent a year and eight months in England dealing with family affairs, following the death of his mother.<ref name=BB262/>

On the 5th May 1793, Digby was appointed First Lieutenant of [[HMS Eurydice (1781)|HMS ''Eurydice'']] serving in the [[Channel Squadron]], and from there to the [[HMS Proserpine (1777)|''Proserpine'']] on the 16th February 1794.<ref name=BB262/> Appointed Second Lieutenant to the 5th rate [[HMS Pallas (1793)|HMS ''Pallas'']] on the 25th March, he received a commendation for saving hundreds of lives when, on the 1st May 1795, the [[first-rate]] [[HMS Boyne|HMS ''Boyne'']] caught fire and exploded in [[Spithead]].<ref name=HC51/> Digby took a small boat close into the blazing ship to rescue men struggling in the water despite the risk of instant annihilation should the ammunition store catch alight, as happened later that day.<ref name=HC51/> Shortly after, on the 20th May 1795, Digby joined [[HMS Dictator (1783)|HMS ''Dictator'']] as First Lieutenant and stayed with her until he was promoted in August that year.<ref name=BB263/>

===First commands===
In August 1795, Digby was promoted to commander of the 16 gun fireship, ''[[HMS Incendiary]]'', operating in [[Quiberon Bay]] and the [[English Channel|Channel]].<ref name=HC51/> On the 16 December 1796 he made [[Post Captain]] and was appointed to the 6th rate, 28 gun, ''[[HMS Aurora (1777)|Aurora]]'', escorting convoys in the waters around Portugal and Spain and damaging the enemy's commercial interests wherever possible.<ref name=HC51/><ref name=BB263>Broadley & Bartelot (1906) p.263</ref> In these first two commands, Digby took 57 enemy vessels before transferring to [[HMS Leviathan (1790)|HMS ''Leviathan'']] under Commodore [[Sir John Duckworth, 1st Baronet|John Duckworth]] and was present at the capture of [[Minorca]] in November 1798.<ref name=HC52>Heathcote (2005) p.52</ref> In 1799 he was given a lucrative independent cruise in the frigate [[HMS Alcmene (1794)|HMS ''Alcmene'']]. Patrolling the waters in and around Portugal and the Azores, Digby captured dozens of small merchant ships and a 28 gun French privateer, ''Courageux''.<ref name=HC52/>

Digby's habit of using his own funds to pay prize money to his crew straight away, rather than have to wait for a judgement from an Admiralty court; coupled with his aggressive, near record breaking prize taking; made him extremely popular with seamen and officers alike and he was never short of volunteers to sail with him.<ref>Heathcote (2005) pp.51-52</ref><ref name=BB263/> One particular capture, that of the [[Spanish ship Santa Brigida|''Santa Brigida'']], contained such wealth that even an Ordinary Seaman received £182.<ref name=HC52/>

===Capture of the Santa Brigida===
Digby claimed that a dream caused him to change course and as a result, at dawn on the 16 October 1799, the ''Alcmene'' encountered two British frigates.<ref name=HC52/> [[HMS Naiad (1797)|HMS ''Naiad'']] and [[HMS Ethalion (1797)|HMS ''Ethalion'']] were chasing two 34 gun Spanish frigates, [[Spanish ship Santa Brigida|''Santa Brigida'']] and ''Thetis''. Digby's ship joined the pursuit and soon after a fourth frigate arrived. At 7.00am the two Spaniards parted company so Naiad followed one frigate, together with {{HMS|Alcmene|1794|2}} and the newly arrived {{HMS|Triton|1796|2}}, while ''Ethalion'', set after the other frigate. By 11.30am, ''Ethalion'' had caught up with her quarry and after a short engagement the Spanish vessel [[Striking the colours|struck her colours]]. ''Ethalion'' had no casualties though the Spaniard had one man killed and nine wounded.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1093|endpage=1094|issue=15197|date=22 October 1799}}</ref> ''Triton'', the fastest of the three British frigates, led the chase of the second frigate. The next morning ''Triton'' struck some rocks off [[Muros, A Coruña|Muros]] as she tried to prevent her quarry from reaching port. ''Triton'' got off the rocks and resumed the chase despite taking on water. She and ''Alcmene'' then exchanged fire with the Spanish frigate, which surrendered before ''Naiad'' could catch up.<ref name=HC52/><ref name=J2.358>James (1837) Vol.II p.358</ref>

The ''Santa Brigida'''s cargo included 1,400,000 [[Spanish Dollar|Pieces of Eight]] and Digby's share of the prize fund came to £40,731, not including the ship itself which wasn't purchased.<ref name=HC52/><ref name=J2.358/> This was more than twice the total prize money Digby had thus far accrued in his career (around £20,000).<ref name=HC52/>

===Peace===
Digby returned to England in early 1801 and spent 10 weeks without a ship. In May he took command of [[HMS Resistance (1801)|HMS ''Resistance'']], on the North American station, in which he captured the French privateer ''Elizabeth'', the last capture before the [[Peace of Amiens]]. <ref name=BB267>Broadley & Bartelot (1906) p.267</ref> Digby spent the next three years on half pay before being given HMS ''Africa'' in July 1805. An old, small battleship, ''Africa'' possessed just 64 guns and was considered by many as much too small to serve in the line of battle in a major fleet engagement. Ordered to join [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson's]] fleet off Cadiz, Digby arrived just days before the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] on the 21st October.<ref name=BB267>Broadley & Bartelot (1906) p.267</ref>

===Trafalgar===
[[File:Trafalgar 1200hr.svg|thumb|''Africa'', off station, complies with Nelson's order to rejoin the fleet by setting a course parallel to the enemy van.]]
The ''Africa'' was also a poor sailor, and on the morning of the battle, as a result of bad weather and a missed signal during the night, Digby found his ship far off station to the north and was thus very isolated.<ref name=HC53/> Nelson saw the predicament and sent a signal instructing Digby to ""Make all sail"", intending him to pull back from the enemy rather than risk being overwhelmed as there were ten enemy ships between ''Africa'' and the British fleet, all larger than ''Africa'' in size.<ref name=HC53>Heathcote (2005) p.53</ref>

Digby indignantly received the order and then deliberately misinterpreted it as an instruction to close with the British fleet to the south, and so weaved between the advancing enemy, engaging each in turn with both broadsides before reaching the melee surrounding the enormous Spanish flagship, the 130 gun [[Spanish ship Nuestra Señora de la Santísima Trinidad (1769)|''Santissima Trinidad'']]. <ref name=HC53/> Believing that she had surrendered, Digby dispatched his first lieutenant, John Smith, on board to take the surrender. Smith and his party actually reached the Spanish quarterdeck unmolested before realising that the ship was still fighting. Fortunately in that chivalrous age the Spanish admiral allowed Smith's party to return to their boat unharmed.<ref name=HC53/>  Sailing south from the battle, ''Africa'' encountered the [[French ship Intrépide|''Intrépide'']] and fought her continuously for 40 minutes until [[HMS Orion (1787)|HMS ''Orion'']] arrived and the French ship surrendered as she was outnumbered.<ref name=HC53/>  In this fight ''Africa'' was very badly damaged and lost 62 men killed or wounded, including most of her officers.

The damage suffered by the ''Africa'' was highlighted in March 2006 when the [[BBC]] television programme ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'' examined a book that was extensively damaged by a [[Round shot|cannonball]].  Digby's inscription inside read ''... this book was shivered in this manner by a whole shot, knocking to pieces the bookcase ... off Cape Trafalgar on 21st October 1805 ... on board the 'Africa' (64 guns).'' signed Henry Digby.

Some 10 years after the battle, Digby received some criticisms for his actions. On hearing a rumour that Nelson had disapproved of Digby's behaviour at Trafalgar, [[Thomas Masterman Hardy|Hardy]] wrote: "".....I beg to assure you that Lord Nelson expressed great satisfaction at the gallant manner in which you passed the enemy's line; and I assure you he appeared most fully satisfied with the conduct of the Africa. I shall be most happy personally to contradict the report, if you will inform me of the Captain's name who conveyed it to you"".<ref>Broadley & Bartelot (1906) pp.270-271</ref>

==Later life==
On the 17th April 1806, he married Lady Jane Elizabeth Coke, a renowned beauty, and daughter of [[Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (seventh creation)|Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester]].<ref name=BB271/> They had three children, the eldest son, [[Edward Digby, 9th Baron Digby|Edward St Vincent]], born 1806, became the 9th Baron Digby in 1856. Their daughter, born in 1807, was the scandalous adventuress, [[Jane Digby]].

For his role at Trafalgar, Digby received a further £973 prize money and a proportion of a government grant amounting £2389 7s 6d, which together with the money accumulated from earlier successes paid for a large manor and a very comfortable life.<ref name=BB271>Broadley & Bartelot (1906) p.271</ref> In 1815 his uncle, Admiral Robert Digby, died leaving Henry the estate in [[Minterne Magna]] to which he retired with his family. Digby did not leave the [[Royal Navy]] however, and continued to serve for many years, advancing by seniority through the ranks; making Rear Admiral{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} in 1819 and Vice Admiral in 1830.{{Ref_label|C|c|none}}He received the [[Order of the Bath]] in 1815 and served as [[High Sheriff of Dorset]] in 1835.
{{Ref_label|B|b|none}} Digby was appointed [[Commander-in-Chief, The Nore]] in 1840.<ref>[http://www.pdavis.nl/ShowCommanders.php William Loney RN]</ref><ref>Heathcote (2005) p.54</ref>  
He died in 1842 and was buried in the local churchyard with many of his family, where his tombstone can still be seen. At the time of his death he was a full Admiral of the Blue {{Ref_label|D|d|none}} and had become a [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]]{{Ref_label|E|e|none}}

Henry's great great granddaughter was the 20th century socialite and diplomat [[Pamela Harriman]] who grew up on the family estate in [[Dorset]].

The team planned to begin play in 2010, until cracks in the concrete structure in the south stands of Frank Clair Stadium led to the demolition of those stands; the league later set a date of 2013 for the team's debut, but lawsuits forced the delay of construction on the stadium to be pushed back even further.<ref name=delays/>

This will be the third CFL team to play in the city.  The [[Ottawa Rough Riders]], formed in 1876, was a founding member of the CFL in 1958 and played until 1996.  A new Ottawa franchise was formed as the ""Renegades"" in 2002, and lasted until the end of the 2005 season.<ref name=""ctv"" />

==History==
The [[Ottawa Renegades]] abruptly ceased operations prior to the [[2006 CFL season]]. The league liquidated the Renegades roster in a dispersal draft and placed the Ottawa CFL franchise up for sale with the intent of eventually returning to the city.

On March 25, 2008, an ownership group led by [[Ottawa 67's]] owner [[Jeff Hunt]] was awarded the franchise. The team will play at a remodelled [[Frank Clair Stadium]] now called TD Place Stadium, and will begin play in 2014 if construction remains on schedule.<ref name=""CFL return"">http://www.torontosun.com/sports/football/2010/06/29/14551341.html CFL will return to Ottawa</ref><ref name=""Lansdowne passes"">http://www.obj.ca/Local/2010-06-29/article-1426235/Lansdowne-passes-by-15-9-margin;-city-eyes-CFL-return/1 Lansdowne passes by 15-9 margin; city eyes CFL return</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfl.ca/article/cfl-in-ottawa-on-track-for-the-2014-season |title=CFL in Ottawa on track for the 2014 season |work=Official Site of the Canadian Football League |publisher=CFL.ca |date=10 October 2012 |accessdate=2014-04-16}}</ref> While in 2008 the franchise was conditionally awarded the right to host the [[102nd Grey Cup|2014 Grey Cup]] game,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tsn.ca/cfl/story/?id=256724&lid=sublink03&lpos=headlines_main |title=Ottawa conditionally awarded 2014 Grey Cup |accessdate=November 21, 2008|date=November 21, 2008 |publisher=[[The Sports Network]]}}</ref> Jeff Hunt has indicated that he would like to postpone the game for a few years to give his franchise a better chance to play in the championship game<ref name=""CFL return""/> and after lawsuits and delays, the stadium renovations will not be completed until 2014.<ref name=delays>{{cite news |work=CTV.ca |title=Lansdowne won't be ready for CFL football until 2014 |date=August 12, 2011 |url=http://ottawa.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20110812/OTT_Lansdowne_110812/20110812/?hub=OttawaHome |accessdate=August 13, 2011}}</ref> Hosting the Grey Cup is a condition included in the agreement giving Hunt control of the franchise.<ref name=garrioch64>{{cite news|last=Garrioch|first= Bruce |date=June 4, 2012|url=http://www.ottawasun.com/2012/06/04/no-grey-cup-for-ottawa-in-2014|newspaper=The Ottawa Sun |title=No Grey Cup for Ottawa in 2014}}.

Concurrently, [[Ottawa Senators]] owner [[Eugene Melnyk]] had announced plans to bid for a [[Major League Soccer]] franchise to play in Ottawa and to build a [[Ottawa Soccer Stadium|new soccer specific stadium]] near the Senators' [[Scotiabank Place]] in support of these plans.  Depending on the stadium's design it could be used by a CFL team instead of the aging Frank Clair Stadium.  However, the CFL and MLS groups have not indicated that they are co-ordinating their plans.  Furthermore, municipal officials have questioned whether the city could support both a CFL and an MLS franchise.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gordon |first=Sean |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080917.SOCCER17/TPStory/Sports |title=globeandmail.com: Sports |publisher=Globe and Mail |date=September 17, 2008 |accessdate=November 24, 2008}}{{dead link|date=June 2013}}</ref>

In April 2009, the staff of the City of Ottawa presented a report to Council on the merits of the Soccer Stadium and Lansdowne proposals. The city held public hearings based on the report, which questioned the necessity of the spending, but gave a slight edge to the Lansdowne proposal. Councillors attempted to find out whether the SSE group would support sharing their stadium with a planned CFL franchise, but the SSE group rejected the possibility. On April 22, 2009, the City of Ottawa Council chose the Lansdowne Live proposal over the SSE proposal as its choice for an outdoor stadium. Over the next several months, negotiations were made leading up to August 26, where a presentation was made to Ottawa City Council would decide the fate of football in Ottawa in the foreseeable future.

On November 12 and 13, City Council held a public debate to discuss what should be done with the area at Lansdowne Park. Guest speakers included [[Mark Cohon]] and former [[Ottawa Rough Riders|Rough Riders]] [[Jock Climie]] and [[Mark Kosmos]] who presented their case as to why Lansdowne Live was an important contributor to the city of Ottawa.<ref>{{cite news|last=Garrioch |first=Bruce |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Football/CFL/News/2009/11/11/11716031-sun.html |title=Lansdowne proposal Ottawa's last shot |publisher=Slam Sports |date=November 11, 2009 |accessdate=November 16, 2009}}</ref> The following Monday, on November 16, it was reported that Ottawa City Council had voted 15–9 in favour of plans to redevelop Lansdowne Park to house a CFL team.<ref>{{cite news|last=Naylor |first=Dave |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/cfls-return-to-ottawa-moves-one-step-closer/article1365927/ |title=CFL's return to Ottawa moves one step closer |publisher=Globe and Mail |date=November 17, 2009 |accessdate=November 16, 2009}}</ref> The Hunt Group had until June 2010 to sort out the details of the redevelopment with construction likely to begin in the spring of 2011.

==2013 CFL Draft==

One year before the Ottawa franchise hits the field for the [[2014 CFL season]] they were allowed to draft four NCAA junior [[Redshirt (college sports)|redshirts]] (players who would participate in the [[2013 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2013 NCAA football season]]). The draft took place May 6, 2013. Ottawa had the last pick in the first 4 rounds of the draft (9, 18, 27, 36 overall selections). They selected [[Nolan MacMillan]] from [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]], [[Connor Williams (Canadian football)|Connor Williams]] from [[Utah State Aggies football|Utah State]], [[Kalonji Kashama]] from [[Eastern Michigan Eagles football|Eastern Michigan]] and [[Tyler Digby]] from [[Robert Morris Colonials football|Robert Morris]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ottawacitizen.com/sports/Ottawa+picks+four+draft/8345594/story.html |title=Ottawa picks four in draft |newspaper=Ottawa Citizen}}{{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref>

==Expansion Draft==
{{Main|2013 CFL Expansion Draft}}
The 2013 CFL Expansion Draft was a three-round [[CFL draft]] held on December 16, 2013 which assign players from existing CFL teams to the new Ottawa team. The structure of the draft was announced on January 19, 2011, which described one round for selecting import players and two rounds for selecting non-import players.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfl.ca/article/expansion-draft-plan-approved |title=Expansion Draft plan approved &#124; CFL.ca &#124; Official Site of the Canadian Football League |publisher=CFL.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-06-09}}</ref> Additionally, if the Ottawa franchise begins play in 2014 they will be given the first pick in every round of the 2014 CFL Draft.

Ottawa selected three players from each of the [[Canadian Football League#Active teams|eight existing teams]] for a total of 24 players. Ottawa was allowed to select eight import players and 16 non-import players with [[quarterback]]s, [[Placekicker|kickers]] and [[punter (football)|punter]]s eligible within their respective import/non-import categories. Ottawa was permitted to select a maximum of two quarterbacks and one kicker/punter, but not select any two of these three players from the same team. The [[CFL Commissioner]] is authorized to resolve any dispute related to player eligibility for the Expansion Draft process.

The selections were announced live at cfl.ca on December 16, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cfl.ca/video/index/id/93869/autostart/true |title=Expansion Draft: Round 1 Selections |work=Official Site of the Canadian Football League |publisher=CFL.ca |date=2013-12-16 |accessdate=2014-04-16}}</ref>

'''Qimonda''' [[Aktiengesellschaft | AG]] ({{Pink Sheets|QMNDQ}}), (pronounced ""key-MON-da"") is a [[DRAM|memory]] company split out of [[Infineon Technologies]] (itself a spun-off business unit of [[Siemens AG]]) on [[1 May]] [[2006]], to form at the time the second largest [[DRAM]] company worldwide, according to the industry research firm [[Gartner]] Dataquest. Headquartered in Munich, Germany, Qimonda is a 300 mm manufacturer, and is one of the top suppliers of DRAM products for the [[personal computer|PC]] and [[server (computing)|server]] markets. Infineon still controls a 77.5% stake, which it has written down (2008). Infineon was on record as having the aim of divesting itself of this stake, with the purpose of becoming a minority stakeholder in 2009. The company has issued 42 million [[American Depository Receipt|ADR]] shares, each ADR share representing one ordinary share in Qimonda.

At its height in 2007, Qimonda employed approximately 13,500 personnel worldwide, including 1,800 in R&D with access to four 300 mm manufacturing sites and operating six major R&D facilities, including its lead R&D center in [[Dresden]], in total covering three [[continents]]. During this time, and on into 2008/09, the price of DRAM continued to decline due to market oversupply, resulting in significant corporate financial losses throughout 2008. In October 2008 major restructuring was announced to try to reduce losses and re-align the company within the struggling DRAM sector. The restructuring saw the sale of Qimonda's interest in its largest 300mm manufacturing site (Inotera, Taiwan - a joint venture between Nanya Technology and Qimonda AG, with QAG owning 35.6% at the time of sale) to its rival, [[Micron Technology]], for approximately $400m in cash. Additionally, CEO Kin Wah Loh announced the closure by January 2009 of the company's single remaining 200mm site in Richmond, Virginia. Other restructuring included the complete closure of the Raleigh R&D facility and the termination of the back-end component and module manufacturing site in Dresden. Altogether, approximately 3000 employees would be made redundant by the changes (excluding the Micron buy-out of Inotera).

With a historical emphasis on PC and server products, the company now focused on products for graphics, mobile and consumer applications using its power-saving deep trench technology.

The company continued to lose money, and sought new investors to help keep the company afloat. The continuing fall in the spot price of commodity DRAM resulted in Qimonda’s 75nm Deep Trench technology no longer being economically viable. The decision was taken in November 2008 to cease production of all commodity DRAM at their Dresden and Richmond 300mm manufacturing sites. Until this point Richmond had predominantly produced graphics DRAM, whilst Dresden manufactured commodity DRAM. This left the Dresden site’s production capability severely under-utilized (although a significant proportion of the line utilization remained as technology development). All of the graphics manufacture was therefore transferred from Richmond to Dresden.

Qimonda’s financial situation worsened during December and the company focused its efforts on securing additional financial support. On December 21st, 2009, Qimonda AG issed a press release stating that they had secured a financial package of €325 million for the ramp up of Buried Worldline technology. The package comprised a €150 million loan from the German state of Saxony, €100 million from an unspecified leading financial institution in Portugal, and €75 million from Infineon, Qimonda’s parent company. In addition, they were provided with the opportunity to draw on €280 million in the form of a state guarantee provided by the German federal government. In return, Qimonda agreed to commit to further development of their R&D and manufacturing sites in Porto, Portugal and Dresden, and to quickly ramp up their 46nm BWT to improve economies of scale at Dresden.

However on January 23rd, 2009, Qimonda AG filed for insolvency protection, stating that the promised package had not become available in time.<ref>http://www.tagesschau.de/wirtschaft/qimonda122.html</ref>
<ref>http://www.manufacturing.net/article.aspx?id=182586</ref> However, subsequent media reporting of the event suggests that the agreement to the package fell apart at the last minute, and so was not available. It is reported that shortly prior to filing, Qimonda had requested a further €300 million on top of the already-agreed €325 million. The backers then refused to meet the demands.<ref>
http://www.eetimes.com/news/semi/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=212902106</ref>
As a separate legal entity, Qimonda North America remained technically solvent. However, without financial support from the parent company or access to revenue from sales (which went to Qimonda AG) there were few options available to QNA. On February 3rd, 2009, QNA announced the closure of its remaining plant in Richmond, VA. This is the first known closure of an operating 300mm production fab. On February 20th, 2009, Qimonda North America filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. 

As a result of the bankruptcy filing, due to the unpaid wages, unpaid vacation balances, no severance, the unpaid severance of those who have severance agreements, and no 60 days notice of a plant closure as required by the WARN act, former workers at Qimonda LLC and Qimonda NA in Richmond, VA have decided to file a class action lawsuit against Qimonda to try and recover the unpaid wages, unpaid vacation balance, unpaid severance, and to get 60 days pay for a plant closure as required by the WARN act. The workers have been informed by legal sources that should they prevail in the lawsuit that they will be paid before unsecured creditors (eg.:vendors), but after secured creditors.

The Richmond site was only capable of manufacturing Qimonda's 75mm Deep Trench technology chips with the manufacturing equipment available there. The concurrent DRAM pricing did not make this a viable manufacturing prospect given the financial situation due to the graphics chips, which were developed by Richmond, being transferred to Dresden by Qimonda AG prior to shutting down Qimonda LLC. Because Dresden was the core DRAM development site, manufacturing equipment capable of producing their (at the time, developmental) 46nm Buried Wordline chips, with its reduced manufacturing cost benefits, was already on site. A corporate decision was taken to consolidate losses by closing the Richmond site. Richmond would not be capable of 46nm BWL manufacture without substantial new equipment investment, requiring money that Qimonda did not have. Qimonda AG, however, moved the 75nm video DRAM processes, which commanded a price premium over commodity PC DRAM products, from Richmond to Dresden in the months prior to shutting down Richmond. Transferring the graphics chips process away from Richmond made the situation at Qimonda LLC intractable.

The Dresden site plods ahead with 46nm Buried Wordline development and produced the first working samples at the beginning of February 2009. It is hoped that the improved technological and cost advantages of the BWL technology will attract new investors or business partners before insolvency cover ends on March 31st, 2009.

On March 13th 2009, following a creditors meeting, Qimonda announced that it was to cease DRAM production in Dresden as of the end of March - the end of the provisional insolvency period.  The company together with the administrator had been searching for fresh capital, but it was not possible to finalise a deal by the end of March.  The 300mm Dresden plant will be idled until such time as its future has been decided.



==Meaning of Qimonda==
""Qimonda"" is an invented name, which falls into the ""evocative"" class by branding agencies. These names are designed to evoke the qualities of the product or company rather than explain the actual goods or services the company supplies. Along with the new name, the company supplies an explanation of it's meaning: ""''The name and brand identity of Qimonda express the philosophy and personality of the company, illustrating its vision and values. The word “Qimonda” carries different meanings and allows associations in different languages. In Chinese, “[[Qi]]”, pronounced as ""ch-ee', stands for breathing and flowing energy, while “monda” denotes “world” in Latin-based languages. ""Qi"", when pronounced as a hard ""k"", suggests “key to the world”, a positive connotation.''""

==Achievements and developments==
Qimonda was among the first DRAM suppliers to transition a substantial portion of the manufacturing to 300 mm technology. Approximately 2/3 of the DRAM bits shipped were manufactured using 300 mm wafers by February 2007. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}. All 200mm manufacturing ended by January 2009.

On September 18th, 2006 Qimonda AG along with Nanya Technology Corporation announced the successful qualification of the 75nm DRAM [[trench isolation|trench]] technology. Process structures of 75nm further reduce chip size compared to the previous 90nm technology thereby increasing potential chip output per wafer by about 40 percent [http://www.qimonda.com/about/press/releases/QAG200609_0018e.html?query=*&sort=date-released&category=&searchroot=].

On September 16th, 2008 Qimonda North America (QNA) announced that no funding would be issued for merit increases or promotions as part of the year-end appraisal process in order to reduce costs.

On October 13th 2008, Qimonda North America announced that it was closing its 200 mm wafer fabrication plant in Richmond, VA, resulting in the loss of 1200 jobs.

On October 27th, 2008 Qimonda North America (QNA) announced that the approved incentive payments due to be paid to employees that month had been postponed until January 16th, 2009, for Richmond employees and February 13th, 2009, for QNA-direct employees.

On October 28th, 2008 Qimonda AG achieved the lowest share price of USD 0.19 on NYSE.

On November 1st, 2007 Qimonda AG announced shipment of first [[GDDR5]] samples
[http://www.qimonda.com/about/press/releases/11_2007_GDDR5_Sampling_e.html?query=*&sort=date-released&category=&searchroot=].

On November 24th, 2008 Qimonda AG achieved the lowest share price of USD 0.05 on NYSE.

In December, 2008 Qimonda North America announced mandatory unpaid leave for all employees at its Richmond site amounting to a 10% salary reduction for exempt staff and approximately 15% reduction for non-exempt employees. The mandatory unpaid leave was expected to last until the beginning of April 2009.

On January 23, 2009 Qimonda AG filed for insolvency (similar to [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy in US courts). The company also published its yearly accounts, which had been delayed several times from its normal release date at the end of October 2008. This showed a drop in net sales to €1.79 billion, down from the previous year's filing of €3.61 billion.

In the days after the announcement general DRAM spot market prices increased by a peak of 26% from their lowest recorded levels in January. However, within a month of the announcement they had returned to their previous level.

On February 3rd, 2009 Qimonda North America announced the closure by April of its remaining 300mm wafer fabrication plant in Richmond, VA. Over the next two months, 1500 employees would be laid off without severance pay. Five hundred employees were made redundant within 24 hours of the announcement. A further 500 will be made redundant over the coming month. The remainder will be made redundant as the plant equipment is sold or mothballed by the beginning of April.

On the same day, Qimonda AG announced the first 46nm working production chips using its Buried Wordline technology, fabricated at its Dresden 300mm plant.

On February 20th, 2009, Qimonda North America and Qimonda Richmond LLC files for Chaper 11 bankruptcy protection in Delaware.


==Bankruptcy and Litigation==
Qimonda AG
Qimonda AG and Qimonda Dresden OHG filed for insolvency protection on January 23rd, 2009. They requested the insolvency protection be backdated to January 1st, 2009. The Munich court appointed Dr. Michael Jaffe as administrator. Dr. Jaffe is a lawyer who specializes in insolvency and restructuring. His most famous previous case was his handling of the collapse of the KirchMedia group. In a press release, CEO Kin Wah Loh stated, “German insolvency laws offers the opportunity to accelerate the restructuring process that has already been started in order to reposition the company back onto a solid base”. Under German law, the operating costs (including salaries) are underwritten by the government for three months. This means that Qimonda has until March 31st, 2009 to secure a solution to its current insolvency issues.

Qimonda North America
On or about Feb 7, 2009, a laid-off Qimonda employee began legal proceedings against QNA for recompense for two months' worth of pay and benefits in a federal class-action lawsuit. The suit alleges that employees were not given their 60-day written notice of termination or 60 days' severance pay required under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN)act.[http://www.timesdispatch.com/rtd/business/local/article/B-QIMO07_20090206-212015/200403/]. Qimonda argues that the “faltering company” exemption under WARN applies, which allows the company to fail to give notice where such advance notice may inhibit the company’s ability to find capital or business with which to continue operating. Since then, several class action lawsuits along similar themes have been reported in the press.

On February 18th, 2009, (two days before filing for bankruptcy) the Richmond Times-Dispatch posted an article stating that QNA CFO Miriam Martinez sent out notices to previously laid-off employees informing them that Qimonda North America and Qimonda Richmond were now not in a financial position to honor its severance agreements to those affected employees from the (previous) 200mm line closure announced in October 2008.
[http://www.timesdispatch.com/rtd/business/local/article/B-QIMO18_20090217-202807/209053/]

Qimonda North America Corp. and Qimonda Richmond LLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on February 20th, 2009 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware. In their filing, the company lists more than $1 billion in assets and liabilities each, and estimated between 10,000 – 25,000 creditors. The files’ listing of top 30 creditors shows a total of over $54.2 million owed to traders. QNA CFO Miriam Martinez issued a statement announcing that under the conditions of the bankruptcy filing, all those employees made redundant by the company on or before the date of bankruptcy could no longer be paid any credit due without court authority. This meant that QNA employees who had not already been paid severance would no longer receive any salary, unused vacation time or severance owed to them. This affected the majority of the workforce. Employees due costs under visa regulations would also receive no compensation.

Those employees remaining with the company from February 20th onwards would only receive pay and benefits from that day forward, up to a maximum of $10,950. Therefore, no payment would be made to those employees for the work performed between February 7th and February 20th.<ref> {{cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-10154742-64.html| title=After chipmaker's collapse, memory prices rise | accessdate 2009-02-11 | first=Brooke |last=Crothers}}</ref>

==Alliances==
Qimonda's strategic alliance with [[Nanya Technology]] Corporation (e.g. the joint-venture [[Inotera]]) ended shortly before the buy-out by rival chip-maker Micron Technology when Nanya declined the offer of joint development of Qimonda's Buried Wordline technology. Inotera will continue to supply DRAM to Qimonda until approximately mid-2009. Qimonda has other strategic alliances with [[China]]-[[Singapore]] [[Suzhou Industrial Park]] Venture Co., Ltd., [[Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation|SMIC]], [[Winbond Electronics Corporation]], [[IBM]], [[Altis]], [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] (for ATI graphics products), [[Toppan Photomasks]], [[Spansion]], and [[Sandisk]].

Qimonda is primarily reliant on its Deep Trench technology in comparison to the stack [[capacitor]] systems of its rival manufacturers. Deep Trench has the benefit of a theoretically smaller footprint than its stack capacitor rival. With approximately one-third lower power consumption due to lower leakage currents, its natural advantages lie in mobile and laptop applications where power supply is a limiting factor. Although offering significant advantages, deep trench technology is technically difficult to manufacture and has led to slippage of Qimonda's technology shrink roadmap in comparison to many of its rivals in recent years.

In 2008, Qimonda announced the development of its Buried Wordline Technology. Retaining many of the advantages of Deep Trench technology, in theory it simplifies the manufacturing process and once again provides Qimonda with a competitive technology shrink roadmap.

[[Image:Ocracoke.svg|thumb|300px|Ocracoke Island]]

'''Ocracoke''' is a [[census-designated place]] (CDP) and unincorporated town located at the southern end of '''Ocracoke Island''', in [[Hyde County, North Carolina|Hyde County]], [[North Carolina]]. The population was 769 as of the 2000 census.

==Geography==
[[Image:OcracokeLighthouseSilverLake.JPG|thumb|left|View of Ocracoke Lighthouse across Silver Lake]] 
The island of Ocracoke is a part of the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]]. It is one of the most remote islands in the [[Outer Banks]], as it can only be reached by one of three public [[ferries]] (two of which are toll ferries), private boat, or private plane. Other than the village of Ocracoke and a few other areas (a campground, a pony pen, a small runway), the entire island is part of the [http://www.nps.gov/caha Cape Hatteras National Seashore]. A single paved two-lane road, [[North Carolina State Highway 12|NC 12]], runs from the village at the southern end of the island to the ferry dock at the northern tip of the island, where a free ferry connects to [[Hatteras Island]]. The second ferry dock, located in the village, has toll connections to [[Swan Quarter, North Carolina]] on the mainland and [[Cedar Island (North Carolina)|Cedar Island]], near [[Atlantic, North Carolina]]. Ocracoke Island Airport (FAA Identifier W95) is located slightly south-east of the village, allowing small aircraft to land.

The village of Ocracoke is located around a small sheltered [[harbor]] called Silver Lake, with a second smaller residential area built around a series of man-made canals called Oyster Creek. The village is located at the widest point of the island, protected from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] by [[sand dunes]] and a [[salt marsh]]. The average height of the island is less than five feet above sea level, and many of the buildings on the island are built on pilings to lift them off the ground. Flooding is a risk during both [[hurricane]]s and large storms. North America's second oldest lighthouse [[Ocracoke Lighthouse]] is situated near Silver Lake and has remained in continuous operation since 1823.

The island is home to what may be considered to be the only non-embassy British soil in the United States.  During [[World War II]], German submarines sank several British ships including the [[HMT Bedfordshire|HMT ''Bedfordshire'']], and the bodies of British sailors were washed ashore.  They were buried in a cemetery on the island.  A lease for the {{convert|2290|sqft|adj=on}} plot, where a British flag flies at all times, was given to the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] for as long as the land remained a cemetery, and the small site officially became a British cemetery. The United States Coast Guard station on Ocracoke Island takes care of the property.  A memorial ceremony is held each year in May.<ref name=""British Cemetery"">{{cite web|url=http://www.offbeattravel.com/british-cemetery-outerbanks.html|title=Offbeat Travel|accessdate=2007-06-20|author=Neala Schwartzberg}}</ref> 

Ocracoke village is located at {{coor dms|35|6|46|N|75|58|33|W|city}} (35.112687, -75.975895){{GR|1}}. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the CDP has a total area of 9.6&nbsp;[[square mile]]s (24.9&nbsp;[[km²]]), of which, 9.6&nbsp;square miles (24.8&nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.1&nbsp;square miles (0.2&nbsp;km²) of it (0.62%) is water.

==Economy==
[[Image:BritishCemeteryOcracoke.JPG|thumb|right|British Cemetery]]
The economy of Ocracoke Island is based almost entirely on [[tourism]]. During the winter, the population shrinks and only a few businesses remain open. During the spring, summer, and early fall, there is an influx of thousands of tourists who reside in weekly rental houses, hotels, and campgrounds. Additionally, many more visitors arrive on the ferry from [[Hatteras Island]] for the day. Several bars, dozens of restaurants, and many shops, stores and other tourist-based businesses are opened for the tourist season, and every single business on the island is independently owned and operated by residents. There are no chains or franchises, which gives the island a distinctive character.

Ocracoke was named America's Best Beach for 2007 by [[Stephen Leatherman|Dr. Stephen Leatherman]], a professor of coastal ecology at [[Florida International University]] who compiles his annual list under the moniker ""Dr. Beach"".  Ocracoke had previously earned the #2 and #3 spots in 2005 and 2006, respectively.

[[Fishing]] makes up a portion of the local economy through commercial fishing and serves to draw tourism through chartered sport fishing. With easy access to the [[Pamlico Sound]], the coastline of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Gulf Stream]], the [[Outer Banks]] area has a variety of different fishing options, from small Sound fish all the way up to [[tuna]] and [[drum (fish)|drum]].

During the winter, the island's only main employers are [[construction]] and the businesses that support the small population. Many islanders use the winter as time off, since they tend to work between 60 and 80 hours a week during the tourist season.  The permanent island population in the off season numbers only in the hundreds.

==History==
[[Image:GovEdwardHyde.JPG|thumb|right|''Governor Edward Hyde'', one of several ferries that connect Ocracoke to the mainland]]
The Outer Banks area was occasionally visited by [[Algonquian]]-speaking Native Americans, but was never heavily settled.  A small village on [[Hatteras Island]] is said to have had forty fighting men.  The area was first described in detail by Giovanni da Verrazzano, an Italian navigator, in 1524.  Verrazzano was unable to navigate the tortuous channels leading into the [[Pamlico Sound]] and assumed that China lay beyond the Outer Banks.  

An attempt at an English settlement was tried at [[Roanoke Island]] in the late 16th century, but it failed.  This effectively halted White settlement until 1663, when Carolina Colony was chartered by King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].  However, remote Ocracoke Island was not permanently settled until 1750, being a pirate haven at times before then.  It was a favorite anchorage of Edward Teach/Thatch/Drummond, et cetera, better known as the [[pirate]] [[Blackbeard]]. He was killed in November 1718 in battle in Teach's Hole, a channel slightly west of the present location of Ocracoke village.

[[Image:NorthernOcracokeBeachSunset.JPG|thumb|left|Sunset on a northern Ocracoke Island beach]]
Throughout the mid- to late-1700s, the Island was home to a number of pilots, who could get smaller ships through the inlet to the Pamlico Sound.  As population increased on the mainland, demand for transshipment of goods from ocean-going vessels increased.  The population was listed as 139 in the 1800 census.  Warehouses were built to hold goods off-loaded from larger ships offshore and then loaded onto smaller [[Schooner]]s to be delivered to plantations and towns along the mainland rivers.

Fort Ocracoke, a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] fortification constructed at the beginning of the [[American Civil War]], was situated on Beacon Island in Ocracoke Inlet, two miles to the west-southwest of Ocracoke village. The Confederates abandoned and partially destroyed the fort in August 1861 after [[United States|Union]] victories on nearby [[Hatteras Island]]. Union forces razed it a month later. Beacon Island subsided beneath the waves of the inlet in the early 20th century. The remnants of Fort Ocracoke were located and identified in 1998.

By the late 19th century, the shipping business was gone, and the [[United States Lifesaving Service]] became a major source of steady income for local men.  Fishing, including charters for tourists, became more important to the livelihood of the area.

==Local dialect==
Ocracoke Island historically had its own distinct dialect of [[English Language|English]], often referred to as a [[brogue]]. A characteristic phrase is ""high tide,"" pronounced somewhat like ""hoi toid."" Due to the influx of tourists and greater contact with the mainland in recent years, however, the Ocracoke brogue has been increasingly influenced by outside dialects.

==Demographics==
As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of 2000, there were 769 people, 370 households, and 219 families residing in the CDP. The [[population density]] was 80.4 people per square mile (31.1/km²). There were 784 housing units at an average density of 82.0/sq&nbsp;mi (31.7/km²). The racial makeup of the CDP was 96.10% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 1.69% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.52% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.26% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.65% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 0.78% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 1.95% of the population.

[[Image:OcracokeSchool.JPG|thumb|right|Ocracoke School, June 2007]]
There were 370 households out of which 17.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 46.8% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 8.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 40.8% were non-families. 30.8% of all households were composed of individuals and 8.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

'''Erik Bradley Wilhelm''' (born November 16, 1965 is a former [[American football]] [[quarterback]] best remembered for his play in the [[National Football League]] from [[1989 NFL season|1989]] to [[1997 NFL season|1997]]. Wilhelm was drafted by the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] of the NFL in the 3rd round of the [[1989 NFL Draft]] following four years at [[Oregon State University]] where he set a number of school passing records. During his six year NFL career Wilhelm was a backup to the durable [[Boomer Esiason]], seeing action in a total of 23 games, starting just once.

After his time in the his NFL career Wilhelm played [[arena football]] for the [[Portland Prowlers]] of the [[Indoor Professional Football League]] in 2000 and for the [[Los Angeles Avengers]] of the [[Arena Football League]] in 2001. 

==Biography==
===Early years===

Erik Bradley Wilhelm was born November 16, 1965 in the American city of [[Dayton, Ohio]].

Wilhelm began playing high school football at [[Gladstone High School (Oregon)|Gladstone High School]] in [[Gladstone, Oregon]], located 12 miles south of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], the state's biggest city. The left-handed quarterback developed into a fledgling star, gaining honors as a junior in 1982 when he was named to the Class-AA Oregon All-State team.<ref name=Thomas>Jim Thomas, [http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1243&dat=19830912&id=e6NYAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qoYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3832,6649024 ""Lakeridge No. 2, so Cougars Try Harder,""] ''The Bulletin'' [Bend, OR], vol. 50, no. 240 (Sept. 12, 1983), pg. D1.</ref>

In the summer of 1983 Wilhelm's family moved to [[Lake Oswego, Oregon]], another Portland suburb, with Erik enrolling at [[Lakeridge High School]] for his senior year.<ref name=Thomas /> There he quickly won the role of starting quarterback, taking over for the school's recently-graduated Class-AAA All-State quarterback, Todd Beahm.<ref name=Thomas /> The highly-touted Wilhelm's collegiate options were broad and he accepted a scholarship to [[Oregon State University]] in [[Corvallis, Oregon]], where he enrolled in the fall of 1984.

===Collegiate career===



===NFL career===



===Post-NFL football===

After being cut from the NFL, Wilhelm returned to the [[Pacific Northwest]], settling in the Southwest [[Washington (state)|Washington]] city of [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]], just north of Portland, Oregon.<ref name=Hampton>Kevin Hampton, [http://democratherald.com/one-more-shot-at-glory/article_4b880285-e9ba-59b2-8046-380ec2172ea6.html ""One More Shot at Glory,""] ''Albany Democrat-Herald,'' July 16, 2000.</ref> There he worked in partnership with his mother as a residential [[property manager]].<ref name=Hampton />

Wilhelm still aspired for a return to the National Football League, believing he still had a sufficient range of skills to play at that level, and for the next three years worked out with a view to returning to the professional game, playing flag football to stay in shape and regularly throwing balls to friend [[Chad Carlson]], a former player in the [[Canadian Football League]].<ref name=Hampton /> Carlson, who formerly played wide receiver for the short-lived [[Portland Forest Dragons]] of the [[Arena Football League]] (AFL), learned of a franchise coming to Portland as part of the new [[Indoor Professional Football League]] (IPFL) and he persuaded Wilhelm to join him in trying out for the team.<ref name=Hampton />

In 2000 Wilhelm joined the [[Portland Prowlers]] of the IPFL as the team's starting quarterback.<ref name=Hampton /> Wilhelm found the camaraderie of the IPFL fulfilling, if not financially lucrative, noting in a 2000 interview:

<blockquote>
""""I'm enjoying it tremendously because it's guys coming together, bonding and going for a common goal to win games and to learn an offense together, to practice together, to get beat up by the other team. Whether you have success or fail, you do it together. There's nothing that can really replace something like that. It's why guys play football. No matter if it's the NFL and you're getting paid a whole bunch of money or this league where you're gettin' beer and pizza money.""<ref name=Hampton /></blockquote>

Wilhelm moved to the better established Arena Football League for the 2001 season, joining the AFL's [[Los Angeles Avengers]] for the 2001 season.

'''Edouard Borovansky''' (24 February 1902 – 18 December 1959) was a [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]]- born Australian [[ballet dancer]], choreographer and director. After touring with [[Anna Pavlova]]'s company, he and his wife settled in Australia where they established the [[Borovansky Ballet]] company. This company provided the foundation for modern ballet in Australia and was subsequently used as the basis for the first national Australian ballet company, [[The Australian Ballet]] which was established in 1962.

==Early years==
[[Image:Borovansky - Le beau Danube.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Edouard Borovansky as The Strong Man in ''Le Beau Danube'', [[Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo]], c.1935  [[National Library of Australia]]]]
Borovanský was born on 24 February 1902 in [[Přerov]], [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. He was the seventh child of František Skřeček, a railway clerk, and his wife Arnošta, and was christened Eduard Josef.<ref name=bio>{{cite journal|url = http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A130253b.htm |title = Borovansky, Edouard (1902 - 1959) |publisher = Australian Dictionary of Biography|first = Robin|last = Grove|pages = 220–222|year = 1993|volume = 13|accessdate = 2008-07-01}}</ref> After graduating school he worked as an accountant before he was called up for military service in the Czechoslovak Air Force.<ref name=bio/> In 1921, he joined the chorus of the [[Olomouc]] Opera Company as a baritone, however as he had an early gymnastic training he was transferred to the ''corps de ballet''.<ref name=bio/> In September 1923 he successfully auditioned for the [[National Theatre (Prague)|Prague National Theatre]] where he began to work his way up the hierarchy before he gained a place in [[Anna Pavlova]]'s touring company in 1928.<ref name=bio/> He began his career as a dancer of character roles by changing his name to Borowanski.<ref name=bio/> He first performed with the Pavlova Ballet in [[Hamburg]], Germany. He then toured for seasons in Britain, South America and Asia.<ref name=bio/> He first toured Australia with the company in 1929. However, the company collapsed after the death of Anna Pavlova in 1930, and he and his companion, the Russian-born Xenia Nikolaevna Krüger, née Smirnoff (1903–1985), scraped a living by teaching children in makeshift studios in Paris, then Prague and Berlin.<ref name=bio/> He married Xenia, a divorcee, on 14 October 1933 at the register office, Westminster, London.<ref name=bio/> In 1932 he joined the [[Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo]]. His notable roles with this company were the Strong Man in ''Le Beau Danube'', Polkan in ''[[Le Coq d'Or]]'' and the Shopkeeper of ''[[La Boutique fantasque]]''.<ref name=bio/> He revisited Australia in 1938 with the company, now renamed The Royal Covent Garden Russian Ballet, however he and his wife decided to remain in Australia at the end of the tour.

==Borovansky Ballet==

After [[Adolf Hitler]]'s annexation of Czechoslovakia in 1939, Borovansky and his wife felt that there was little future for ballet in the region and the outbreak of World War II a few months later gave them little incentive or opportunity to return to Europe.<ref name=bio/> With his wife Xenia, he established a ballet school in [[Melbourne]] named the Melbourne Academy of Russian Ballet.<ref name=bio/> His wife was the principal teacher, while Borovansky handled the administration. By 1940 the academy had grown and Borovansky was able to establish the Borovansky Australian Ballet Company which held its first season at the [[Comedy Theatre, Melbourne]] in December of that year.<ref name=bio/> The principal dancer was [[Laurel Martyn]]. The ballet company was variously called the Borovansky Ballet, the Borovansky Australian Ballet Company, the Borovansky Ballet of 40 and the Borovansky Jubilee Ballet. Borovansky had also encouraged the formation of the Melbourne Ballet Club, which displayed and encouraged new choreography.<ref name=bio/> 

From 1940 his company presented studio performances for the Melbourne Ballet Club of original choreography by himself, Xenia Borovansky, [[Laurel Martyn]] and Dorothy Stevenson. Works choreographed and presented during this period include Martyn's ''Sigrid'', Stevenson's ''Sea Legend'' (whose setting was designed by [[William Constable]]) and Martyn's ''En Saga''.<ref name=bio/> In 1942, Borovansky's company presented a five-night season at the [[Princess Theatre, Melbourne]]. The season was such a success that it convinced [[J. C. Williamson| J. C. Williamson Theatres Ltd]] that ballet ""was potentially big business"".<ref name=bio/> Borovansky now had commercial backing and access to theatres across Australia. In return his company was formed to provide commercial success. The backing of J. C. Williamson Theatres Ltd was a turning-point, for without it the company would have died similarly to the [[Sydney]]-based Kirsova Ballet (1941–44), which had refused commercial backing and collapsed despite an Australia-wide following.<ref name=bio/> The company therefore performed ""large, colourful, familiar works which were what '[[J. C. Williamson|the Firm]]' preferred"".<ref name=bio/> 

Borovansky was naturalised as a British subject<ref>At that time, there was no Australian citizenship; this came into existence only in January 1949.</ref> in 1944, becoming a well-known figure in [[Melbourne]] and ""notorious for his despotic treatment of his dancers"".<ref name=bio/> In 1944, the 40-strong company had toured the mainland capitals, [[Tasmania]] and New Zealand with a repertoire that included ''[[Giselle]]'', ''[[Swan Lake]]'' (Act II), ''[[Les Sylphides]]'', ''En Saga'', ''[[Capriccio Italien]]'', [[Frederick Ashton]]'s ''[[Façade (poem)|Façade]]'', and Borovansky's symphonic fantasy, ''Vltava''. In 1945, the company toured mainland Australia again. This tour included an 8-month season in Melbourne featuring the ""tried favourites of pre-war 'Russian ballet'"" - ''Le Carnaval'', ''[[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Schéhérazade]]'' and ''Le Beau Danube'' - as well as a new work by Borovansky, ''Terra Australis''.<ref name=bio/> 

At the end of this season Laurel Martyn left the company to form, out of the original Melbourne Ballet Club, the Victorian Ballet Guild. Her choice of a small, experimental dance company over the glamorous professional stage highlighted the dilemma Borovansky faced.<ref name=bio/> Borovansky had built a ""strong, commercially attractive operation on the basis of the school run by his wife and a keen sense of what the public would pay to see"".<ref name=bio/> However, as his company was funded by J. C. Williamson's, they dictated what the company could do. Borovansky's company had expanded and now included such dancers as [[Paul Hammond (ballet dancer)|Paul Hammond]], Martin Rubinstein, Leon Kellaway, Peggy Sager, [[Kathleen Gorham]], [[Vassilie Trunoff]] and Edna Busse. For the next 18 months, the company (now called the Borovansky Ballet) became the dance-chorus for two operettas and toured New Zealand a second time while also holding seasons of ''[[Coppélia]]'' and other favourites.<ref name=bio/> The company was disbanded in 1948 due to lack of financial backing. 

In 1951, Borovansky assembled a second company called the Borovansky Jubilee Ballet which was sponsored by the Education in Music and Dramatic Arts Society as well as J. C. Williamson's. He presented ambitious productions with the company such as a full-sized ''[[Petrouchka]]'' that year. While in 1952, he produced a complete ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|Sleeping Princess]]''. Seasons included [[Léonide Massine]]'s ''[[Symphonie Fantastique]]'' (1954), [[John Cranko]]'s ''[[Pineapple Poll]]'' (1954) and [[David Lichine]]'s full-length ''[[The Nutcracker]]'' (1955). During its 1957 season, it hosted guest artists from the [[Royal Ballet]] including [[Margot Fonteyn]].<ref name=bio/> Borovansky choreographed a number of works for his company. Some, like ''The Black Swan'', ''Terra Australis'' and ''The Outlaw'', were overtly Australian in theme. Later, choreographers who worked for him included company members Paul Grinwis and Robert Pomié. He also commissioned David Lichine to create an original ballet which premiered on 17 February 1956 as ''Corrida''.

==Works==
<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Martyn Vltava.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Laurel Martyn]] in Borovansky's ''Vltava'', 1940, [[National Library of Australia]]]] --> 

Borovansky choreographed several works for his company. His first work, ''Vltava'', premiered at the [[Comedy Theatre, Melbourne]], on 9 December 1940 as part of the first season of the Borovansky Australian Ballet Company.<ref name=vltava>{{cite web|url = http://www.australiadancing.org/subjects/1261.html|publisher = Australia Dancing|title = Vltava (1940 - )|accessdate = 2008-07-22}}</ref> ''Vltava'' was ""patriotically Czech in music, theme and imagery""<ref name=bio/> as it drew on his European heritage for inspiration. Borovansky choreographed this work to the symphonic poem ''[[Má vlast]]'' by Czech composer [[Bedrich Smetana]].<ref name=vltava/> The [[Vltava]] is the longest river in the Czech Republic and thus the main role was named the Spirit of the River and was originally danced by [[Laurel Martyn]].<ref name=vltava/> The main male roles of the Hunters were taken by Noel Neville, George Hale, Reg Bartram and Laurie Rentoul. In the original performances the music was played on two pianos by Marjorie Summers and Edna Bennet.<ref name=vltava/> According to the programme of the performance, Borovansky ""endeavoured to express the spirit of the young Czechoslovakia"".<ref name=vltava/>  The cast wore white shorts and shirts for their costumes, which suggested that Borovansky was making a political statement on the nationalistic youth movements of Czechoslovakia with which he was familiar.<ref name=vltava/> The choreography was reminiscent of [[Leonide Massine]]'s ''Choreartium''.<ref name=vltava/> This work remained in the repertoire of the company until at least 1945 when it was taken on tour to New Zealand.<ref name=vltava/>

Borovansky's second ballet was ''Terra Australis'', which is the first all-Australian ballet.<ref name = terra>{{cite web |url = http://www.australiadancing.org/subjects/142.html|title = Terra Australis (1946 - )|publisher = Australia Dancing|accessdate = 2008-07-22}}</ref> It premiered in [[Melbourne]] on 25 May 1946, performed by his company.<ref name=terra/> The ballet's libretto was by Tom Rothfield while the score was commissioned from Esther Rofe. The ballet focused on the subject of Australia's colonisation by white settlers. This was represented in the form of a love triangle where the virginal Spirit of Australia was courted by a white explorer and an Aboriginal lover.<ref name=terra/> The original cast featured Peggy Sager as the Spirit of Australia, Martin Rubinstein as the Explorer and [[Vassilie Trunoff]] as the Aborigine.<ref name=terra/> The ballet was restaged in 1947 with [[Kathleen Gorham]] as the new lead. 

Borovansky's next ballet, ''The Black Swan'', also had an Australian theme. It was  based on a historical incident in 1697 when [[Willem de Vlamingh|Captain Vlaming]] from the [[Dutch East India Company]] was exploring Australia.<ref name=swan>{{cite web|url = http://www.australiadancing.org/subjects/1721.html|publisher = Australia Dancing|title = Black Swan, The (1949 - )|accessdate = 2008-08-02}}</ref> He discovered and named [[Rottnest Island]] and the river on which the city of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] now stands.<ref name=swan/> There were a large number of black swans on the river which drew Captain Vlamingh's attention and his crew captured several and took them back to [[Java]].<ref name=swan/> Thus, the main plot of the ballet was the story of the Captain entranced by a black swan, which symbolised a new land.<ref name=swan/> The ballet premiered in Melbourne in the Borovansky Ballet's 1949 season. The work was revived both in 1950 and 1951.<ref name=swan/>

==Death and legacy==

Borovansky died of a coronary occlusion on 18 December 1959 at [[Randwick, New South Wales|Randwick]], and was buried with Anglican rites in [[Box Hill Cemetery]], Melbourne.<ref name=bio/> He was survived by his wife; they had no children. His company provided the basis for the creation of a national Australian company. The artistic director of the Borovansky Ballet, [[Peggy van Praagh]], founded the [[Australian Ballet]] in 1962. His dancers also provided the nucleus of the national ballet company - including such dancers as [[Garth Welch]], Robert Pomie, Jeffrey Kovel, Estella Nova and Rosemary Mildner. During his last season of ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|Sleeping Princess]]'', [[Marilyn Jones]] was hailed overnight as a ballerina.<ref name=bio/> The Borovansky Ballet company was ""both an intensely personal creation, where one man did almost everything, and a national ballet, eager to draw on whatever talent it could employ"".<ref name=bio/> On 21 March 1980 a gala tribute celebrating Borovansky's work as the founder of ballet in Australia was held at the [[Sydney Opera House]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.australianballet.com.au/uploads/Timeline_feb%2007.pdf |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080730062901/http://www.australianballet.com.au/uploads/Timeline_feb+07.pdf |archivedate = 2008-07-30|title = The Australian Ballet timeline|page=7|publisher = Australian Ballet|accessdate = 2008-07-22}}</ref> The programme consisted of ''[[Pineapple Poll]]'', ''[[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Schéhérazade]]'' and ''[[Graduation Ball]]''. He was posthumously inducted into the Hall of Fame at the Australian Dance Awards in 1999.

==Early life and baseball career==
Ty Cobb was born in [[Narrows, Georgia|Narrows]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], in 1886 as the first of three children to Amanda Chitwood Cobb and William Herschel Cobb.

Ty spent his first years in baseball as a member of the Royston Rompers, the [[semi-professional]] Royston Red, and the Augusta Tourists of the [[South Atlantic League|Sally League]].  However, the Tourists cut Cobb two days into the season. He then went to try out for the Anniston Steelers of the semi-pro Tennessee-Alabama League, with his father's stern admonition still ringing in his ears: ""Don't come home a failure"".<ref name=Kanfer>{{cite web |last=Kanfer|first=Stefan| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1050490-1,00.html |title=Failures Can't Come Home |date=[[April 18]], [[2005]] |publisher=Time |accessdate=2007-02-26 }}</ref> Cobb promoted himself by sending several postcards to [[Grantland Rice]], the sports editor of the ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|Atlanta Journal]]'' under several different aliases. Eventually, Rice wrote a small note in the ''Journal'' that a ""young fellow named Cobb seems to be showing an unusual lot of talent.""<ref name=KossuthMinors>{{cite web |last=Kossuth |first=James | url=http://wso.williams.edu/~jkossuth/cobb/minors.htm |title=Ty Cobb: The Minors |accessdate=2007-01-30 }}</ref>  After about three months, Ty returned to the Tourists.  He finished the season hitting .237 in 35 games.  

In 1905, the Tourists' management sold Cobb to the [[American League]]'s [[Detroit Tigers]] for a sum between [[United States Dollar|US$]]500 and $750.<ref name=NYTObit>{{cite news |title=Ty Cobb, Baseball Great, Dies; Still Held 16 Big League Marks |publisher= [[New York Times]]|pages=1,21 |date=[[July 18]], [[1961]] }} </ref><ref name=NYTWoolf>{{cite news |first=S.

William Cobb suspected his wife of infidelity, and was sneaking past his own bedroom window to catch her in the act. She only saw the [[silhouette]] of what she presumed to be an intruder, and, acting in self-defense, shot and killed her husband.<ref name=Kanfer/> Mrs. Cobb was charged with murder and then released on a $10,000 [[recognizance]] [[bail|bond]].<ref name=AmandCobbBond>{{cite court |litigants=State of Georgia vs. Amanda Cobb (bond hearing)  |vol=vol2 |reporter=1281p.478 |opinion=9 |court=Franklin County, Georgia, Superior Court |date= [[September 29]], [[1905]] |url=http://content.sos.state.ga.us/u?/adhoc,53}}</ref> She was [[acquittal|acquitted]] on [[March 31]], [[1906]].<ref name=AmandCobbVerdict>{{cite court |litigants=State of Georgia vs. Amanda Cobb (murder trial verdict) |vol=vol2 |reporter=1282p040 |opinion=1 |court=Franklin County, Georgia, Superior Court |date= [[March 31]], [[1906]] |url=http://content.sos.state.ga.us/u?/adhoc,54}}</ref>

==Major League career==
===Early years===
[[Image:Cobbsign.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Cobb signs a $5000 contract for 1908 after a bitter holdout.]]
Three weeks after his mother killed his father, Cobb played [[Center fielder|center field]] for the Detroit Tigers.  On [[August 30]], [[1905]], in his first major league at-bat, Cobb [[Double (baseball)|doubled]] off the [[New York Yankees|New York Highlanders]]'s [[Jack Chesbro]].  That season, Cobb managed to bat only [[Batting average|.240]] in [[Major League Baseball season|41 games]].  Nevertheless, he showed enough promise as a [[rookie]] for the Tigers to give him a lucrative $1,800 contract for 1906.<ref name=NYTWoolf/>

Although rookie [[hazing]] was customary, Cobb could not endure it in good humor, and he soon became alienated from his teammates. He later attributed his hostile temperament to this experience: ""These old-timers turned me into a snarling wildcat.""<ref name=NGECobb/>

The following year ([[1906 in sports|1906]]) he became the Tigers' [[Starting lineup|full-time]] center fielder and hit .316 in 98 games.  He would never hit below that mark again.<ref name=BaseballRefCobbCareerStats/> Cobb, firmly entrenched in center field, led the Tigers to three consecutive [[American League pennant winners 1901-68|American League Pennants]] from 1907 to 1909.  Detroit would lose each [[World Series]], however, with Cobb's [[World Series|post-season]] numbers being much below his career standard.

In one notable game on [[September 2]], [[1907]], Cobb reached [[First baseman|first]], [[Stolen base|stole]] [[Second baseman|second]], stole [[Third baseman|third]], and then stole [[Baseball field#home_plate|home]] on consecutive attempts.<ref name=stolenbases>{{cite web | url=http://www.thebaseballpage.com/lists/SB_cycle.php |title=Stoled Second, Third and Home in the Same Game |accessdate=2007-02-26 |publisher=thebaseballpage.com}}</ref>  He finished that season with a league high .350 batting average and also led the league with 212 hits,  and 119 [[Run batted in|Runs batted in]] (RBI).<ref name=BaseballRefCobbCareerStats/> At age 20, Cobb became the youngest player to win a [[List of Major League Baseball batting champions|batting championship]] and held this record until 1955 when fellow Detroit Tiger [[Al Kaline]] won the batting title when he was one day younger than Cobb.<ref name=BaseballPageKaline>{{cite web | url=http://www.thebaseballpage.com/players/kalinal01.php |title=Al Kaline |accessdate=2007-02-27 |publisher=thebaseballpage.com}}</ref> Despite great success on the field, Cobb was no stranger to controversy off it. At [[spring training]] in 1907, he fought a black groundskeeper over the condition of the Tigers' field in [[Augusta, Georgia]]. Ty also ended up choking the man's wife when she intervened.<ref name=ESPNSchwartz>{{cite web |last=Schwartz|first=Larry | url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014142.html |title=He was a pain ... but a great pain |accessdate=2007-01-30 |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}</ref>

In September 1907, Cobb began a relationship with [[The Coca-Cola Company]] that would last the remainder of his life.  By the time he died, he owned three [[Bottling company|bottling plants]], in [[Santa Maria, California|Santa Maria]], [[California]]; [[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls]], [[Idaho]]; and [[Bend, Oregon|Bend]], [[Oregon]]; and owned over 20,000 [[Share (finance)|shares of stock]].<ref name=HallofFameCoke/>  He was also a celebrity spokesman for the product.<ref name=HallofFameCoke/>

The following season, the Tigers bested the [[Chicago White Sox]] for the American League pennant.  Cobb again won the batting title, although he hit ""only"" .324 that year.  Despite another loss in the Series, Cobb had something to celebrate.  In August 1908, he married Charlotte ""Charlie"" Marion Lombard, the daughter of prominent [[Augusta, Georgia|Augustan]] Roswell Lombard. In the offseason, Cobb and his wife lived in his father-in-law's Augusta estate, ''The Oaks''. In November of 1913, the couple moved into their own house on Williams Street.<ref name=Price1996>{{cite web |url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/history/cobb.html |title=Aggressive play defined Ty Cobb  |accessdate=2007-02-07 |last=Price |first=Ed |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=[[June 21]], [[1996]] |publisher= [[The Augusta Chronicle]] }}</ref>

[[Image:Cobbstealing3rd.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Charles M. Conlon|Conlon]]'s famous picture of Cobb stealing third during the 1909 season.]]
The Tigers won the American League pennant again in [[1909 in sports|1909]].  During the Series Cobb stole home in the second game, igniting a three-run rally, but that was the high point for Cobb.  He ended batting a lowly .231 in his last World Series, as the Tigers lost in seven games.  Although he performed poorly in the post-season, Cobb won the regular-season [[Triple crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]] by hitting .377 with 107 RBI and nine [[home run]]s - all [[inside-the-park home run|inside-the-park]].  Cobb thus became the only player of the modern era to lead his league in home runs in a given season without hitting a ball [[home run|over the fence]].

It was also in 1909 that [[Charles M. Conlon]] snapped his famous photograph of a grimacing Ty Cobb sliding into third base amid a cloud of dirt, which visually captured the grit and ferocity of Cobb's playing style.<ref name=conlon>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/archives/conlon/cobb/photo2.html |title=Ty Cobb |publisher=Times Mirror Co.|year=1998 |accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref>

===1910 and the Chalmers Award controversy===
In [[1910 in sports|1910]], Cobb and [[Nap Lajoie]] were in competition for the American League batting title.  Cobb was ahead by a slight margin going into the last day of the season.  The prize for the winner of the title was a [[Chalmers Automobile]].  Cobb sat out the game to preserve his average.  Lajoie, whose team was playing the [[Baltimore Orioles|St. Louis Browns]], notched eight hits in a [[Doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]].  Six of those hits were [[Bunt (baseball)|bunt]] [[Single (baseball)|singles]] that fell in front of the third baseman.  It turned out that Browns manager, [[Jack O'Connor (catcher)|Jack O'Connor]], had ordered [[third baseman]] [[Red Corriden]] to play deep, on the outfield grass, so as to allow the popular Lajoie to win the title.  A seventh hit is credited despite a [[Error (baseball)|wild throw]] to [[first baseman|first base]].  The [[St. Louis Post-Dispatch|St. Louis Post]] was one of numerous newspapers to criticize the [[shenanigan]]s, writing, ""All St. Louis is up in arms over the deplorable spectacle, conceived in stupidity and executed in jealousy.""<ref name=BaseballLibraryTyCobb>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/C/Cobb_Ty.stm  |title=Ty Cobb |accessdate=2007-01-30 |publisher=BaseballLibrary.com}}</ref> <!-- This quote is at the bottom of the cited article in the section entitled ""From the Baseball Chronology"" for Oct 9, 1910 -->

[[Image:CobbLajoie.jpg|frame|right|Cobb and [[Nap Lajoie|Napoleon ""Nap"" Lajoie]]]]
After some wrangling, American League president [[Ban Johnson]] declared all batting averages official, with Cobb seemingly hanging on to win, .3850687 to .3840947.<ref name=BaseballLibraryTyCobb/><ref name=BaseballLibraryNapLajoie>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/L/Lajoie_Nap.stm  |title=Nap Lajoie|accessdate=2007-02-26 |publisher=BaseballLibrary.com}}</ref>  With the Browns deliberately helping an opponent to surpass a total which was unknowingly inaccurate, the ensuing mathematical mess was described by one writer, ""It could be said that 1910 produced two bogus leading batting averages, and one questionable champion.""<ref name=BasbellDigestVass>{{cite journal |last=Vass |first=George |year=2005 |month=June |title=Baseball records: fact or fiction: some of the game's historic marks may be inaccurate, but they continue to be a driving force in the popularity of statistics among fans |journal=Baseball Digest |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_4_64/ai_n13684071 |accessdate=2007-01-30 }}</ref> The Chalmers people, however, decided to award an automobile to both Cobb and Lajoie.<ref name=BaseballLibraryNapLajoie/>  The next year, the Chalmers Award was given to the player ""most valuable"" to his team, and the modern [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award |Most Valuable Player Award]] was born, with Cobb winning the American League version unanimously.

Muddying the waters further, it is the 1910 season which accounts for the statistical discrepancy in Cobb's career hit total, which was long reported as 4,191.  A Detroit Tigers [[box score ]]was mistakenly counted twice in the season-ending calculations, thus giving Cobb an additional two hits in three [[at bat]]s.  Beyond awarding him two nonexistent hits, it also raised Cobb's 1910 batting average from .383 to .385. Lajoie is credited with a .384 average for the 1910 season, and thus the downwardly revised figure would also cost Cobb one of his 12 batting titles.

On [[April 11]], [[1981]], the office of baseball commissioner [[Bowie Kuhn]] released a three-page statement in which the Official Baseball Records Committee ""reaffirmed several important records and statistics, including the 1910 batting championship of Ty Cobb"".<ref name=NYTOnefortheBook>{{cite news |title=Sports World Specials: One for the Book |publisher= [[New York Times]]|page=C2 (Final Edition) |work=Sports Desk |date=[[April 13]], [[1981]] }},</ref>. Kuhn's office futher explained that the reasoning behind reaffirming the record was for several reasons: Al President Ban Johnson had already ruled on the matter in 1910 in Cobb's favor; the events were over 70 seasons ago and there should be some statute of limitations; and the Cobb-Lajoie statistics should not be changed without a thorough review of all statistics of that time and such a review would be impractical.<ref name=NYTOnefortheBook/> However, the game's statisticians have ignored  the commissioner's stance.<ref name=BaseballRefCobbCareerStats/><ref name=BaseballAlmanacCobbCareerStats>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=cobbty01|title=Ty Cobb Stats |accessdate=2007-02-27 |publisher=Baseball Almanac}}</ref><ref name=ESPNCobbCareerStats>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlbhist/alltime/playercard?playerId=2522 |title=Ty Cobb |accessdate=2007-02-27 |publisher=[[ESPN]]}}</ref>

===1911 Season and onward===
[[Image:Cobb Jackson.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Ty Cobb and Joe Jackson in Cleveland]]
Cobb was regarded not just as an athlete, but a psychological competitor. Cobb was having a typically fine year in [[1911 in sports|1911]], which included a 40-game [[hitting streak]]. Still, [[Shoeless Joe Jackson|”Shoeless” Joe Jackson]] had a .009 point lead on him in batting average. What happened next is discussed in Cobb's autobiography. Near the end of the season, Cobb’s Tigers had a long series against Jackson and the [[Cleveland Indians|Cleveland Naps]]. Fellow Southerners, Cobb and Jackson were personally friendly both on and off the field. Cobb used that friendliness for his gain. However, Cobb suddenly ignored Jackson whenever Jackson said anything to him. When Jackson persisted, Cobb snapped angrily at Jackson, making him wonder what he could have done to enrage Cobb. As soon as the series was over, Cobb unexpectedly greeted Jackson and wished him well. Cobb felt that it was these mind games that caused Jackson to ""fall off"" to a final average of .408, while Cobb himself finished with a .420 average.<ref name=BaseballLibraryTyCobb/>

Cobb led the AL in numerous categories besides batting average, including 248 hits, 147 runs scored, 127 RBI, 83 stolen bases, 47 doubles, 24 triples, and a .621 slugging average. The only major offensive category in which Cobb did not finish first was home runs, where [[Frank Baker]] surpassed him 11-8. Cobb's dominance at the plate is suggested by this statistic: he [[Strikeout|struck out]] [[Baseball#Batting|swinging]] only twice during the entire 1911 season.<ref name=BaseballRefCobbCareerStats/> He was awarded another Chalmers, this time for being voted the AL MVP by the [[Baseball Writers Association of America]].

The game that may best illustrate Cobb's unique combination of skills and attributes occurred on [[May 12]], [[1911]]. Playing against the [[New York Yankees]], Cobb scored a run from first base on a single to [[Right fielder|right field]], then scored another run from second base on a [[wild pitch]]. In the 7th [[innings|inning]], he tied the game with a 2-run double. The Yankee [[catcher]] began vociferously arguing the call with the [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]], going on at such length that the other Yankee [[infielder]]s gathered nearby to watch. Realizing that no one on the Yankees had [[Time-out (sport)|called time]], Cobb strolled unobserved to third base, and then casually walked towards home plate as if to get a better view of the argument. He then suddenly slid into home plate for the game's winning run.<ref name=BaseballLibraryTyCobb/>

On [[May 15]], [[1912]], Cobb assaulted Claude Lueker, a [[heckler]], in the stands in New York. Lueker and Cobb traded insults with each other throughout the first three innings, and the situation climaxed when Lueker called Cobb a ""half-[[nigger]]."" Cobb then climbed into the stands and attacked the handicapped Lueker, who due to an industrial accident had lost all of one hand and three fingers on his other hand. When onlookers shouted at Cobb to stop because the man had no hands, Cobb reportedly replied, ""I don't care if he has no feet!""<ref name=Kanfer/> The league suspended him, and his teammates, though not fond of Cobb, went on [[strike action|strike]] to protest the suspension prior to the [[May 18]], [[1912]], game in Philadelphia. For that one game, Detroit fielded a replacement team made up of college and sandlot ballplayers, plus two Detroit coaches, and lost, 24-2. Some of major league baseball's all-time negative records were established in this game, notably the 26 hits allowed by [[Allan Travers]], who pitched the sport's most unlikely [[complete game]]. The strike ended when Cobb urged his teammates to return to the field.<ref name=KossuthPartIII>{{cite web |last=Kossuth |first=James | url=http://wso.williams.edu/~jkossuth/cobb/race.htm |title=How Cobb Got Along With Others: Part 3: Ty and Those Outside Baseball |accessdate=2007-01-30}}</ref> 

During Cobb's career he was involved in numerous fights, both on and off the field, and several profanity-laced shouting matches.  For example, Cobb and umpire [[Billy Evans]] arranged to settle their in-game differences with a fistfight, to be conducted under the grandstand after the game.  Members of both teams served as the spectators, and broke up the scuffle after Cobb had knocked Evans down, pinned him, and began choking him.  Cobb once slapped a black elevator operator for being ""uppity."" When a black night watchman intervened, Cobb pulled out a knife and stabbed him (The matter was later settled out of court).""<ref name=NGECobb/>

===1915-1921===
[[Image:Cobbruth.jpg|frame|left|Babe Ruth (left) and Ty Cobb]]
In 1915, Cobb set the single season steals record when he stole 96 bases.  That record stood until [[Maury Wills]] broke it in 1962.<ref name=BaseballRefSeasonSB>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/SB_season.shtml |title=Single-Season Leaders for Stolen Bases |accessdate=2007-02-07 |publisher=Sports Reference, Inc }}</ref>  Cobb’s streak of five batting titles (believed at the time to be nine straight<ref name=BasbellDigestVass/>) ended the following year when he finished second with .371 to [[Tris Speaker]]’s .386.<ref name=BaseballRefBattingTitles/>

In 1917, Cobb hit in 35 consecutive games, and he remains the only player with two 35-game [[hitting streak]]s to his credit (Cobb had a 40-game hitting streak in 1911).<ref name=BaseballRefLongHitStreaks>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Longest_Hitting_Streaks |title=Longest Hitting Streaks |accessdate=2007-02-07 |publisher=Sports Reference, Inc }}</ref>  Over his career, Cobb had six hitting streaks of at least 20 games, second only to [[Pete Rose]]'s seven.<ref name=BaseballPageRose>{{cite web |url=http://www.thebaseballpage.com/players/rosepe01.php |title=Player Pages: Pete Rose |accessdate=2007-02-07}}</ref> <!-- This reference says Rose had eight hitting streaks of 20 or more consecutive hits, not 7 -->

Also in 1917, Cobb starred in the motion picture ''[[Somewhere in Georgia]]. '' Based on a story by sports columnist Grantland Rice, the film casts Cobb as ""himself"", a small-town Georgian bank clerk with a talent for baseball.<ref name=IMDB>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0158971/ |title=Somewhere in Georgia |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=2007-02-07 }} </ref>

By [[1920 in baseball|1920]], [[Babe Ruth]] had established himself as a power hitter, something Cobb was not considered.  When Cobb and the Tigers showed up in New York to play the Yankees for the first time that season, writers billed it as a showdown between two stars of competing styles of play.  Ruth hit two homers and a triple during the series while Cobb got only one single in the entire series.

As Ruth's popularity grew, Cobb became increasingly hostile toward him.  Cobb saw Ruth not only as a threat to his style of play, but also to his style of life.  While Cobb preached ascetic self-denial, Ruth gorged on hot dogs, beer, and women.<ref name=Nation05082006>{{cite web |url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060522/zirin |last=Zirin |first=Dave |title=Bonding With the Babe |publisher=[[The Nation]] |date=[[May 8]], [[2006]] |accessdate=2007-03-01 }} </ref><ref name=MF112006>{{cite web |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_9_20/ai_n6244977 |last=Kalish|first=Jacob |title=Fat phenoms: are hot dogs and beer part of your training regimen?

After enduring several years of seeing his fame and notoriety usurped by Ruth, Cobb decided that he was going to show that swinging for the fences was no challenge for a top hitter.  On [[May 5]], [[1925]], Cobb began a two-game hitting spree better than any even Ruth had unleashed.  He was sitting in the [[Dugout (baseball)|dugout]] talking to a reporter and told him that, for the first time in his career, he was going to [[home run|swing for the fences]].  That day, Cobb went 6 for 6, with two singles, a double, and three home runs.<ref name=BaseballLibMay1925>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/chronology/1925MAY.stm |title=May 1925 |accessdate=2007-02-08 |publisher=Baseballlibrary.com}}</ref>  His 16 total bases set a new AL record.<ref name=BaseballLibMay1925/>  The next day he had three more hits, two of which were home runs.<ref name=BaseballLibMay1925/>  His single his first time up gave him 9 consecutive hits over three games.<ref name=BaseballLibMay1925/>  His five homers in two games tied the record set by [[Cap Anson]] of the old Chicago NL team in 1884.<ref name=BaseballLibMay1925/> Cobb wanted to show that he could hit home runs when he wanted, but simply chose not to do so.  At the end of the series, 38-year-old Cobb had gone 12 for 19 with 29 total bases, and then went happily back to bunting and hitting-and-running.  Ruth stated, ""I could have had a lifetime .600 average, but I would have had to hit them singles. The people were paying to see me hit home runs.""<ref name=BaseballLibFrommer>{{cite web |last=Frommer |first=Harvey |date=[[July 13]], [[2004]]  |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/chronology/1925MAY.stm |title=The 90th Anniversary of Babe Ruth's Major-League Debut  |accessdate=2007-02-10 |publisher=Baseballlibrary.com}}</ref> 

On [[August 19]], [[1921]], in the second game of a double header against [[Elmer Myers]] of the [[Boston Red Sox]], Cobb collected his 3,000th hit. Cobb still holds the distinction as of 2007 of being the youngest ballplayer, only 34, and the player with the fewest at-bats, 8,093, to reach the milestone.<ref name=SportingNews08061999>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/exhibits/online_exhibits/3000_hit_club/cobb_ty.htm |title=The 3000 Hit Club: Ty Cobb |accessdate=2007-02-10 |publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc }}</ref><ref name=HallofFameCobb3000>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/archives/sports2000/numbers/172730.html |date=[[August 6]], [[1999]] |title=Inside the numbers: 3,000 hits |accessdate=2007-02-10 |publisher=[[Sporting News]] }}</ref>

===Cobb as player/manager===
[[Frank Navin]], the Detroit Tigers owner, signed Cobb to take over for [[Hughie Jennings]] as manager for the [[1921 in sports|1921]] season.  Cobb signed the deal on his 34th birthday for $32,500.  Even though he was recognized as one of baseball's legends, his fellow players were not fond of him.<ref name=OReilly/> As a coach, Cobb had high expectations for his team and felt most of his players fell below that standard.<ref name=ngeorgiacobb>{{cite web |url=http://ngeorgia.com/people/cobbt.html |title=Tyrus Raymond ""Ty"" Cobb: a North Georgia Notable |publisher=About North Georgia |accessdate=2007-02-27 }}</ref>

The closest he came to winning the pennant race was in [[1924 in sports|1924]] when the Tigers finished in third place, six games behind the pennant-winning [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]].  The Tigers had finished second in [[1922 in sports|1922]] but were 16 games behind the Yankees.

Cobb blamed his lackluster managerial record (479 wins-444 losses) on the frugal Navin, who had passed up a number of quality players that Cobb wanted to add to the team.  In fact, Navin had saved money by hiring Cobb to manage the team.

Also in 1922, Cobb tied a batting record set by [[Willie Keeler|Wee Willie Keeler]], with four five-hit games.  This has since been matched by [[Stan Musial]], [[Tony Gwynn]] and [[Ichiro Suzuki]].

At the end of 1925 Cobb was once again embroiled in a batting title race, this time with one of his teammates and players, [[Harry Heilmann]].  In a doubleheader against the [[Baltimore Orioles|St. Louis Browns]] on [[October 4]], [[1925]], Heilmann got six hits, leading the Tigers to a sweep of the doubleheader and beating Cobb for the batting crown, .393 to .389.  Cobb and Browns manager [[George Sisler]] each pitched in the final game.  Cobb pitched a perfect inning.

===Cobb moves to Philadelphia===
[[Image:Ty_cobb.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Ty Cobb baseball card, American Tobacco Company, 1909-11]]
Cobb finally called it quits from a 22-year career as a Tiger in November [[1926 in sports|1926]] by announcing his retirement.<ref name=BaseballLibraryTyCobb/> Shortly thereafter, Tris Speaker also retired as player-manager of the Cleveland team.  The retirement of two great players at the same time sparked some interest, and it turned out that the two were coerced into retirement because of allegations of game-fixing brought about by [[Dutch Leonard (left-handed pitcher)|Dutch Leonard]], a former pitcher for Cobb.<ref name=BaseballLibraryDutchLeonard>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/L/Leonard_Dutch92.stm |title=Dutch Leonard 
|accessdate=2007-03-01 |publisher=BaseballLibrary.com}}</ref>

Leonard accused Wood and Cobb of betting on a Tiger-Cleveland game played in Detroit on [[September 25]], [[1919]], in which they allegedly coerced a Detroit victory to win the bet. Leonard claimed proof existed in letters written to him by Cobb and Wood.<ref name=BaseballLibraryDutchLeonard/> [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis|Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] held a secret hearing with Cobb and Speaker as well as former pitcher and outfielder [[Smokey Joe Wood|Joe Wood]].<ref name=BaseballLibraryDutchLeonard/>  A second secret meeting amongst the AL directors led to Cobb and Speaker resigning with no publicity; however, rumors of the scandal led Judge Landis to hold additional hearings.<ref name=BaseballLibraryDutchLeonard/> Leonard subsequently refused to appear at the hearings. Cobb and Wood admitted to writing the letters, but they claimed it was a horse racing bet, and that Leonard's accusations were the result of Cobb's earlier release of Leonard from the Tigers to the [[minor league baseball|minor leagues]].<ref name=BaseballLibraryDutchLeonard/> Speaker denied any wrongdoing.<ref name=BaseballLibraryDutchLeonard/>

On [[January 27]], [[1927]], Judge Landis cleared Cobb and Speaker of any wrongdoing because of Leonard's refusal to appear at the hearings.<ref name=BaseballLibraryDutchLeonard/> Landis allowed both Cobb and Speaker to return to their original teams, and both became [[free agent]]s.<ref name=BaseballLibraryDutchLeonard/>  Speaker signed with the [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]] for [[1927 in sports|1927]]; Cobb signed with the [[Oakland Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]].  Speaker then joined Cobb in Philadelphia for the [[1928 in sports|1928]] season.  Cobb says he came back only to seek vindication and so that he could say he left baseball on his own terms. 

Cobb played regularly in 1927 for a young and talented team that finished second to one of the greatest teams of all time, the [[Murderers' Row|1927 Yankees]], which won 110 games.  He returned to Detroit to quite a welcome on [[May 11]], [[1927]].  Cobb doubled in his first at bat, to the cheers of Tiger fans.  On [[July 18]], [[1927]], Cobb became the first player to enter the [[4000 hit club]] when he doubled off former teammate [[Sam Gibson]] of the Detroit Tigers at [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Navin Field]].<ref name=BaseballLibraryTyCobb/>

The 1927 season was also the last of [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]] pitcher [[Walter Johnson]]'s career.<ref name=BaseballRefJohnsonCareerStats>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/j/johnswa01.shtml |title=Walter Johnson Career Statistics|accessdate=2007-02-27 |publisher=Sports Reference, Inc }}</ref>  With their careers largely overlapping, Ty Cobb faced Johnson many times. Cobb got the first hit allowed in Johnson's career on [[August 2]], [[1907]];<ref name=BaseballLibraryJohnson>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/J/Johnson_Walter.stm  |title=Walter Johnson |accessdate=2007-02-27 |publisher=BaseballLibrary.com}}</ref> however, Cobb had little success against Johnson over the next 8 years. That situation changed after Johnson hit Detroit's [[Ossie Vitt]] with a pitch on [[August 10]], [[1915]], seriously injuring him. After hitting Vitt, Johnson appeared shaken as he then allowed four runs in the first inning and another four through the 6th inning.<ref name=BaseballLibraryOssieVitt>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/V/Vitt_Ossie.stm  |title=Ossie Vitt |accessdate=2007-02-27 |publisher=BaseballLibrary.com}}</ref> Cobb's conclusion from this incident was that Johnson feared hitting opponents, and Cobb used this knowledge to his advantage by standing closer to [[Home plate#home plate|home plate]] when batting against Johnson.<ref name=BaseballLibraryOssieVitt/>
From that point forward, Cobb averaged .435 against Johnson, a marked improvement over his previous season high of .222 in the preceding eight years.<ref name=BaseballLibraryOssieVitt/>. Over his entire career, Cobb faced Johnson in 67 games and averaged .335.<ref name=BaseballLibraryJohnson/>

Cobb returned again in 1928.  He played less frequently due to his age and the blossoming abilities of the young A's, who were again in a pennant race with the Yankees. On [[September 3]], [[1928]], Ty Cobb [[pinch hitter|pinch hit]] in the 9th inning of the first game of a double-header against the Senators and doubled off Bump Hadley for his last career hit.<ref name=BaseballLibraryTyCobb/> Against the Yankees on [[September 11]], [[1928]], Cobb had his last at bat, [[Types of batted balls in baseball|popping]] [[Out (baseball)|out]] against pitcher Hank Johnson to [[shortstop]] Mark Koenig as a pinch hitter in the 9th inning.<ref name=BaseballLibraryTyCobb/>   He then announced his retirement, effective at the end of the season.<ref name=BaseballLibraryTyCobb/> Cobb ended his career with 23 consecutive seasons batting .300 or better (the only season under .300 being his rookie season), a Major League record not likely to be broken.<ref name=BaseballRefCobbCareerStats/>

In the winter of 1930, Cobb moved into a Spanish ranch estate on Spencer Lane in the millionaire's community of [[Atherton, California|Atherton]] outside [[San Francisco, California]].  At that same time, his wife Charlie filed the first of several divorce suits;<ref name=Time04271931>{{cite journal |year= 1931 |title=Milestones |month=April 27 |journal=Time |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,741506-1,00.html |accessdate=2007-02-27 }}</ref> however, she withdrew that suit shortly thereafter.<ref name=Time05111931>{{cite journal |year= 1931 |title=Milestones |month=May 11 |journal=Time |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,741673-1,00.html |accessdate=2007-02-27 }}</ref> Charlie finally divorced Cobb in 1947,<ref name=Time063019347>{{cite journal |year= 1947 |title=Milestones |month=June 30 |journal=Time |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,854767,00.html |accessdate=2007-02-27 }}</ref> after 39 years of marriage, the last few of which she lived in nearby [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]].

Cobb had never had an easy time being a father and husband.  His children had found him to be demanding, yet also capable of kindness and extreme warmth. Cobb had expected his boys to be exceptional athletes, especially baseball players.  Cobb, Jr. flunked out of [[Princeton University|Princeton]],<ref name=NYTIMES12021994>{{cite web |url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?title1=COBB%20(MOVIE)&title2=&reviewer=Janet%20Maslin&pdate=19941202&v_id= |title=FILM REVIEW; A Hero Who Was a Heel, Or, What Price Glory? |accessdate=2007-02-06 |publisher=[[New York Times]] |last=Maslin |first=Janet |date=[[December 2]], [[1994]] }}</ref> would have rather played [[tennis]] than baseball.<ref name=KossuthCobbHangsemup>{{cite web |last=Kossuth |first=James | url=http://wso.williams.edu/~jkossuth/cobb/race.htm |title=Cobb Hangs 'em Up ...eventually |accessdate=2007-02-06}}</ref> Cobb, Jr. became a physician and practiced in [[Dublin, Georgia]], until his death on [[September 9]], [[1952]], from a [[brain tumor]].<ref name=NYTJrObit>{{cite news |title=Ty Cobb's Son Dies at 42 |publisher= [[New York Times]]|pages=29 |date=[[September 10]], [[1952]] }} </ref>

A personal achievement came in February 1936, when the first [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] election results were announced.  Cobb had been named on 222 of 226 ballots, outdistancing Babe Ruth, [[Honus Wagner]], [[Christy Mathewson]] and [[Walter Johnson]], the only others to earn the necessary 75% of votes to be elected in that first year.  His 98.2 percentage stood as the record until [[Tom Seaver]] received 98.8% of the vote in 1992 ([[Nolan Ryan]] and [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] have also  surpassed Cobb, with 98.79% and 98.53% of the votes, respectively). Those incredible results show that although many people disliked him personally, they respected the way he played and what he accomplished.  In 1998, [[Sporting News]] ranked him as third on the list of [[The Sporting News list of Baseball's Greatest Players|100 Greatest Baseball Players]].

By then, Cobb drank and smoked heavily, and spent a great deal of time complaining about the lack of fundamental skills with modern-day players.<ref name=NGECobb/>  Cobb was known to help out young players.  He was instrumental in helping [[Joe DiMaggio]] negotiate his rookie contract with the New York Yankees, but ended his friendship with [[Ted Williams]] when the latter suggested to him that [[Rogers Hornsby]] was a greater hitter than Cobb.

Another bittersweet moment in Cobb's life reportedly came in the late 1940s when he and sportswriter Grantland Rice were returning from the [[The Masters Tournament|Masters]] golf tournament.  Stopping at a South Carolina liquor store, Cobb noticed that the man behind the counter was ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson, who had been banned from baseball almost 30 years earlier following the [[Black Sox Scandal]].  But Jackson did not appear to recognize him, and finally Cobb asked, ""Don't you know me, Joe?""  “Sure I know you, Ty,” replied Jackson, “but I wasn’t sure you wanted to speak to me. A lot of them don’t.”<ref name=Frommer>

===Later life===
At 62, Cobb remarried to 40-year-old Frances Fairbairn Cass.<ref name=TimeCobb>{{cite web | date=[[September 26]], [[1949]] | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,800761-1,00.html |title=The Old Gang |publisher= [[Time]]||accessdate=2007-02-10}}</ref>  This childless marriage also failed, and they divorced in 1956.<ref name=Time05211956>{{cite web | date=[[May 21]], [[1956]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,808526,00.html |title=Milestones|publisher= [[Time]]||accessdate=2007-02-10}}</ref>

When two of his three sons died young, Cobb was alone, with few friends left.  He therefore began to be generous with his wealth, donating $100,000 in his parents' name for his hometown of Royston to build a modern 24 bed hospital now called the [[Cobb Memorial Hospital]].  He also established the [[Cobb Educational Fund]], which awarded scholarships to needy Georgia students bound for college, by endowing it with a $100,000 donation in 1953.<ref name=TyCobbMuseumPhilanthropy/>

Cobb knew that another way he could share his wealth was by having biographies written that would set the record straight and teach young players how to play.  [[John McCallum (author)|John McCallum]] spent some time with Cobb to write a combination how-to and biography entitled ''The Tiger Wore Spikes: An Informal Biography of Ty Cobb'' that was published in 1956.<ref name=TigerWoreSpikes>{{cite book |first=John |last=McCallum |authorlink= John McCallum |title=The Tiger Wore Spikes: An Informal Biography of Ty Cobb |pages=240 pages |publisher=A.

After McCallum completed his research for the book, Cobb was again alone and had a longing to return to Georgia.  In December of 1959, Cobb was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]], [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]] and [[Bright's disease]], a degenerative kidney disorder.<ref name=NGECobb/><ref name=TyCobbMuseumDYK>{{cite web | url=http://www.tycobbmuseum.org/didyouknow.shtml.htm |title=Did You Know? |publisher= The Ty Cobb Museum |accessdate=2007-02-26}}</ref> He did not trust his initial diagnosis, however, so he went to Georgia to seek advice from doctors he knew, and they found his prostate to be cancerous.  They removed it at [[Emory University|Emory University Hospital]] in Atlanta, but that did little to help Cobb.  From this point until the end of his life, Cobb criss-crossed the country, going from his lodge in Tahoe to the hospital in Georgia.

It was also during his final years that Cobb began work on his autobiography, ''My Life in Baseball: The True Record,'' with writer [[Al Stump]].  Their collaboration was contentious, and after Cobb's death, was described by Stump in other works, including the film ''[[Cobb (film)|Cobb]]''.

===Death===
In his last days Cobb spent some time with the old movie comedian [[Joe E. Brown (comedian)|Joe E. Brown]], talking about the choices Cobb had made in his life.  He told Brown that he felt that he had made mistakes, and that he would do things differently if he could.  He had played hard and lived hard all his life, and had no friends to show for it at the end, and he regretted it.  Publicly, however, Cobb claimed not to have any regrets: ""I've been lucky. I have no right to be regretful of what I did"".<ref name=NewsweekJuly1961>{{cite journal |quotes= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1961|month= July 31 |title= |journal=[[Newsweek]] |volume= |issue= |pages=p.54 |id= |url= |accessdate= }}</ref>

He checked into Emory Hospital for the last time in June 1961, bringing with him a paper bag with over $1 million in [[Bond (finance)|negotiable bonds]] and his [[pistol]].<ref name=Zacharias/>  This time his first wife, Charlie, his son Jimmy and other family members came to be with him for his final days.

Efforts to create a Ty Cobb Memorial in Royston initially failed, primarily because most of the artifacts from his life were sent to the Baseball Hall of Fame in [[Cooperstown, New York]], and the Georgia town was viewed as too remote to make a memorial worthwhile.  However, on [[July 17]], [[1998]], the 37th anniversary of Cobb's death, the [[Ty Cobb Museum]] opened its doors in Royston.  On [[August 30]], [[2005]], his hometown hosted a 1905 baseball game to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Cobb's first major league game.  Players in the game included many of Cobb's descendants as well as many citizens from his hometown of Royston.  Another early-1900s baseball game was played in his hometown at Cobb Field on [[September 30]], [[2006]], with Cobb's descendants and Roystonians again playing. Cobb's personal bat boy from his major league years was also in attendance and threw out the [[ceremonial first pitch|first pitch]].

Archer and Charles Lethbridge Kingsford (London & NY, 1894). The rowel-spurs (of a later date) are probably an error by the 19th-century artist copying the seal.]]
'''Balian of Ibelin''' (early [[1140s]]&ndash;[[1193]]) was an important noble in the [[crusade]]r [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] in the [[12th century]]. 

==Early life==

Balian was the youngest son of [[Barisan of Ibelin]], and brother of [[Hugh of Ibelin|Hugh]] and [[Baldwin of Ibelin|Baldwin]]. His father, who was probably Italian, had been a knight in the [[County of Jaffa]], and had been rewarded with the lordship of [[Ibelin]] after the revolt of [[Hugh II of Le Puiset]]. Barisan married Helvis, heiress of the wealthy [[lordship of Ramla]]. Balian's name was also Barisan, but the name (found in [[Tuscany]] and [[Liguria]]) was adapted in [[Old French language|Old French]] to ""Balian"" in the course of the 12th century; he is sometimes known as Balian the Younger or Balian II when his father is also referred to as Balian. He is also called Balian of Ramla or Balian of Nablus. In [[Latin]] his name appears variously as Balian, Barisan, Barisanus, Balianus, Balisan, and Balisanus. Arabic sources call him ''Balian ibn Barzan''. His precise year of birth is unknown, but he was of the age of majority (usually 15) by 1158, when he first appears in [[charter]]s, having been described as under-age (""''infra annos''"") in 1155. (H. E. Mayer has suggested a limited degree of competence may have been accepted from the age of 8, reducing Balian's age further, but the examples given of this are of males of the royal house, whose situation was somewhat different.) 

After the death of Balian's eldest brother Hugh c. 1169, the castle of Ibelin passed to the next brother, Baldwin. Baldwin, preferring to remain lord of [[Ramla]], gave it to Balian. Balian held Ibelin as a vassal of his brother, and indirectly as a [[vavasour|rear-vassal]] of the king, from whom Baldwin held Ramla.

==Succession disputes==

Balian and Baldwin supported [[Raymond III of Tripoli]] over [[Miles of Plancy]] as regent for King [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]] in 1174, and in 1177 the brothers were present at the [[Battle of Montgisard]], leading the vanguard victoriously against the strongest point of the Muslim line. That year Balian also married [[Maria Komnene, Queen consort of Jerusalem|Maria Comnena]], widow of [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|King Amalric I]], and became stepfather to their daughter Princess [[Isabella of Jerusalem|Isabella]]. He received the lordship of [[Nablus]], which had been a [[dower]] gift to Maria following her marriage to Amalric. In 1179, Baldwin was captured by [[Saladin]] after the [[Battle of Marj Uyun]], and Balian helped arrange for his ransom and release the next year; the ransom was eventually paid by [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Manuel I Comnenus]], Maria's great-uncle. 

In 1183 Balian and Baldwin supported Raymond against [[Guy of Lusignan]], husband of [[Sibylla of Jerusalem]] and by now regent for Baldwin IV, who was dying of [[leprosy]]. The king had his 5-year-old nephew [[Baldwin V of Jerusalem|Baldwin of Montferrat]] crowned as co-king in his own lifetime, in an attempt to prevent Guy from succeeding as king. Shortly before his death in spring 1185, Baldwin IV ordered a formal crown-wearing by his nephew at the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]. It was Balian himself - a notably tall man - who carried the child Baldwin V on his shoulder at the ceremony, signifying the support of Isabella's family for her nephew. Soon after, the 8-year old boy became sole king. When he, too, died in 1186, Balian and Maria, with Raymond's support, put forward Maria's daughter Isabella, then about 14, as a candidate for the throne. However, her husband, [[Humphrey IV of Toron]], refused the crown and swore fealty to Guy. Balian reluctantly also paid homage to Guy, while his brother refused to do so and exiled himself to [[Antioch]]. Baldwin placed Balian in charge of raising his son Thomas, the future lord of Ramla, who did not go with his father to Antioch.

==Dispute between Raymond and Guy==

Balian remained in the kingdom, as an advisor to Guy. At the end of 1186, [[Saladin]], the sultan of [[Egypt]] and [[Damascus]], threatened the borders of the kingdom after Guy's ally [[Raynald of Chatillon]], [[lord of Oultrejordain]], had attacked a Muslim caravan. Saladin was allied with the garrison of [[Tiberias]] in the north of the kingdom, a territory held by Raymond III. Guy gathered his army at [[Nazareth]], planning to besiege Tiberias, but Balian disagreed with this, and instead suggested that Guy send an embassy to Raymond in Tripoli, hoping the two could be reconciled before Guy made a foolish attack on Saladin's larger army. The first embassy was a failure and the situation remained unchanged throughout the early months of 1187. After [[Easter]] of that year, Balian, [[Gerard of Ridefort]] (Grand Master of the [[Knights Templar]]), [[Roger des Moulins]] (Grand Master of the [[Knights Hospitaller]]), [[Reginald of Sidon]], and [[Joscius, Archbishop of Tyre]]) were sent on a new embassy to Tripoli. During the journey they stopped at Balian's fief of Nablus, and Balian planned to remain behind briefly while the others went ahead. On [[May 1]], the Templars and Hospitallers were defeated by Saladin's son al-Afdal at the [[Battle of Cresson]]; Balian was still a day behind, and had also stopped at [[Sebastea]] to celebrate a [[feast day]]. After reaching the castle of La Fève, where the Templars and Hospitallers had camped, he found that the place was deserted, and soon heard news of the disastrous battle from the few survivors. Raymond heard about the battle as well and met the embassy at Tiberias, and agreed to accompany them back to Jerusalem.

==The Battle of Hattin==

Since al-Afdal's army had been allowed to enter the kingdom through their alliance with Raymond, the count now regretted his actions and reconciled with Guy. Guy marched north and camped at [[Sephoria]], but insisted on marching the army across a dry and barren plain to relieve Tiberias. The army had no water and was constantly harassed by Saladin's troops, and was finally surrounded at the Horns of [[Hattin]] outside Tiberias early in July. In the [[Battle of Hattin|battle that followed]] on [[July 4]], Balian and [[Joscelin III of Edessa]] commanded the rearguard, but the crusader army was completely defeated. The anonymous text, ''De Expugnatione Terrae Sanctae per Saladinum Libellus'' claims that Balian, Raymond and Reginald of Sidon fled the field in the middle of the battle, trampling ""''the Christians, the Turks and the Cross''"" in the process - but this is not corroborated by other accounts, and reflects the author's hostility to the ''Poleins''. 

The defeat was a disaster for the kingdom of Jerusalem: King Guy was taken prisoner, and nearly every town and castle soon fell to Saladin. Balian, Raymond, Reginald, and Payen of Haifa were among the few leading nobles who managed to escape to [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]]. Raymond and Reginald soon left to attend to the defence of their own territories, and Tyre came under the leadership of [[Conrad of Montferrat]], Baldwin V's paternal uncle, who had arrived not long after Hattin. Balian was to become one of his closest allies. Leaving Tyre, Balian asked Saladin for permission to return through the lines to Jerusalem to escort his wife and their children to Tripoli. Saladin allowed this, provided that Balian swear not to remain in the city and raise arms against him.

==Defence of Jerusalem==

When Balian arrived in the city, the inhabitants begged him to stay, and he was absolved of his oath to Saladin by [[Patriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem|Patriarch Eraclius]], who argued that the greater need of Christendom was stronger than his oath to a non-Christian. Balian was recruited to lead the defence of the city, but he found that there were under fourteen, possibly as few as two, other knights there, so he created sixty new knights from the ranks of the [[burgess]]es. [[Sibylla of Jerusalem|Queen Sibylla]] seems to have played little part in the defence, and oaths were taken to Balian as lord. With Eraclius, he prepared for the inevitable siege by storing food and money. Saladin indeed arrived to [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|besiege the city]] in September, after he had conquered almost all of the rest of the kingdom, including Ibelin, Nablus, Ramla, and Ascalon. The sultan felt no ill-will to Balian for breaking his oath, and arranged for an escort to accompany Maria and their children to Tripoli. As the highest ranking lord remaining in Jerusalem, Balian, as [[Ibn al-Athir]] wrote, was seen by the Muslims as holding a rank ""more or less equal to that of a king.""

Saladin was able to knock down portions of the walls but was unable to gain entrance to the city. Balian then rode out to meet with the sultan, to report to him that the defenders would rather kill each other and destroy the city than see it taken by force. After negotiations, it was decided that the city would be handed over peacefully, and that Saladin would free seven thousand men for 30 000 bezants; two women or ten children would be permitted to take the place of one man for the same price. Balian handed over the keys to the [[Tower of David]] (the citadel) on [[October 2]]. There was a 50-day period for the payment of ransoms. Those who could not pay for their freedom were forced into slavery; Saladin freed some of them, however, and allowed for an orderly march away from Jerusalem, preventing the sort of massacre that had occurred when the crusaders captured the city in 1099. Balian and Patriarch Eraclius had offered themselves as hostages for the ransoming of the remaining Frankish citizens, but Saladin had refused. The ransomed inhabitants marched away in three columns. Balian and the Patriarch led the third, which was the last to leave the city, probably around [[November 20]]. Balian joined his wife and children in [[County of Tripoli|Tripoli]].

[[Image:BalianofIbelin1490.JPG|right|frame|Balian of Ibelin surrendering the city of [[Jerusalem]] to [[Saladin]], from ''Les Passages faits Outremer par les Français contre les Turcs et autres Sarrasins et Maures outremarins'', c. [[1490]].]]

==Balian as king-maker, and the Third Crusade==

The fall of Jerusalem, and the death of Sibylla at the [[Siege of Acre]] in 1190, led to a dispute over the throne of the kingdom. Balian's stepdaughter Isabella was now rightful queen, but Guy refused to concede his title, and Isabella's husband Humphrey - who had let her cause down in 1186 - remained loyal to him. If Isabella were to succeed, she needed a politically acceptable and militarily competent husband, the obvious candidate being Conrad of Montferrat, who also had some claim as Baldwin V's paternal uncle. Balian and Maria seized Isabella and talked her into agreeing to a divorce. There were precedents: the annulment of Amalric I's marriage to Agnes of Courtenay, and the unsuccessful attempts to force Sibylla to divorce Guy.

Isabella's marriage was annulled by [[Ubaldo Lanfranchi]], [[Archbishopric of Pisa|Archbishop of Pisa]], who was [[Papal legate]], and [[Philip of Dreux]], [[Bishop of Beauvais-Noyons-Senlis#Bishops of Beauvais|Bishop of Beauvais]]. The Bishop of Beauvais then married her to Conrad (controversially, since his brother had been married to her half-sister and it was uncertain whether he had been divorced by his Byzantine wife). The succession dispute was prolonged by the arrival of [[Richard I of England]] and [[Philip II of France]] on the [[Third Crusade]]: Richard supported Guy, as a Poitevin vassal, while Philip supported Conrad, his late father's cousin. 

Balian and Maria's role in Isabella's divorce and their support for Conrad as king earned them the bitter hatred of Richard and his supporters. [[Ambroise]], who wrote a poetic account of the crusade, called Balian ""more false than a goblin"" and said he ""should be hunted with dogs"". The anonymous author of the ''Itinerarium Peregrinorum et Gesta Regis Ricardi'' wrote that Balian was a member of a ""council of consummate iniquity"" around Conrad, accused him of taking Conrad's bribes, and said of Maria and Balian as a couple: 
:''Steeped in Greek filth from the cradle, she had a husband whose morals matched her own: he was cruel, she was godless; he was fickle, she was pliable; he was faithless, she was fraudulent.'' 

On [[28 April]], [[1192]], only days after his kingship was confirmed by election, Conrad was [[assassin]]ated in Tyre. It is said that one of the two [[Hashshashin]] responsible had entered Balian's household in Tyre some months previously, pretending to be a servant, in order to stalk his victim; the other may have similarly infiltrated Reginald of Sidon's or Conrad's own household. Richard was widely suspected of involvement in the murder. Isabella, who was expecting her first child ([[Maria of Montferrat]]), married [[Henry II of Champagne]] only a week later. 

Balian became one of Henry's advisors, and later that year, (along with William of Tiberias) he commanded the rearguard of Richard's army at the [[Battle of Jaffa]]. Later, he helped negotiate the [[Treaty of Ramla]] between Richard and Saladin, ending the crusade. Under this treaty, Ibelin remained under Saladin's control, but many sites along the coast which had been reconquered during the crusade were allowed to remain in Christian hands. After Richard departed, Saladin compensated Balian with the castle of [[Vassals of the Kingdom of Jerusalem#Lordship of Caymont|Caymont]] and five other nearby sites, all outside Acre.

==Legacy==

Balian died in 1193, in his early fifties. With Maria he had four children: 
* Helvis, who married (1) [[Reginald of Sidon]]; (2) [[Guy of Montfort]].
* [[John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut|John of Ibelin]], [[Vassals of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|Lord of Beirut]] and [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|constable of Jerusalem]], and regent for his niece [[Maria of Montferrat|Maria of Montferrat, Queen of Jerusalem]]. He married (1) Helvis of Nephin; (2) Melisende of Arsur.
* Margaret, who married (1) Hugh of Saint-Omer (stepson of Raymond III of Tripoli); (2) Walter of Cæsarea.
* Philip of Ibelin, Regent of [[Cyprus]], who married Alice of Montbéliard. 

Balian's [[squire]] [[Ernoul]], who was with him on the embassy to Tripoli in 1187, wrote parts of the [[Old French language|Old French]] continuation of the [[Latin]] chronicle of [[William of Tyre]] (William had died in 1186, before the fall of Jerusalem). Although this family of manuscripts now often bears his name, his account only survives in fragments within it, mainly for the period 1186-88, with a heavy bias in favour of the Ibelin family.

'''Balian''' became a common name in the Ibelin family in the 13th century. Balian, lord of Beirut, son of John and grandson of the above Balian, succeeded his father as lord of Beirut in 1236. Balian of Beirut's brother, also named John, had a son named Balian; this Balian was lord of [[Arsuf]] and married [[Plaisance of Antioch]]. 

The name also passed into the family of the Greniers of Sidon, since Balian's daughter Helvis and Reginald of Sidon named their son Balian.

==Balian in fiction==
[[Image:KoHposter.jpg|thumb|Orlando Bloom as Balian in ''Kingdom of Heaven'']]
Balian appears in [[Ronald Welch]]'s children's novel ''Knight Crusader'' (1954) as a fat, middle-aged baron. He is a sympathetic major character in British author [[Graham Shelby]]'s two novels of Outremer, ''The Knights of Dark Renown'' ([[1969]]) and its sequel ''The Kings of Vain Intent'' (1970). However, the first is based on now-outdated research. In the sequel, Balian and Maria are depicted as manipulated by Conrad, whom Shelby (without any historical evidence) portrays as an evil sadist, and they become his enemies. Shelby even depicts Balian telling Conrad he wishes he could kill him, although all the historical evidence indicates they were close friends and allies. Balian is also portrayed in [[Alan Gordon]]'s fourth work in the Fool's Guild Mysteries, ''The Widow of Jerusalem'' ([[2003]]), as the wise adviser of Conrad and Isabella.  
  
A highly fictionalised version of Balian is the main character of the [[2005 in film|2005 film]] ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (movie)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'', played by [[Orlando Bloom]] as a young man with a questioning, 21st-century sensibility regarding religion and social attitudes. In the film, Balian's father, named Godfrey (played by [[Liam Neeson]]), returns to [[Europe]] to find his long-lost illegitimate son, a [[blacksmith]] in [[France]], and encourages him to come to the Holy Land as his heir. The movie does not include any of Balian's brothers, and the character may be a composite of Balian and Baldwin of Ibelin: he is portrayed as having a love affair with [[Sibylla of Jerusalem|Sibylla]], possibly derived from the ''Old French Continuation of William of Tyre'''s claims about her and Baldwin. The movie's Godfrey, however, is closer to the real Balian in age and in his friendship with [[Raymond III of Tripoli]], although not in his friendship with the King, [[Baldwin IV]], who in reality was wary of the Ibelins' ambitions. The film depicts Balian as the sole commander of the defence of Jerusalem: instead of working in close alliance with Patriarch Eraclius, he is depicted as his enemy. In the film's coda, Balian is depicted as having an amicable verbal exchange with [[Richard I of England]], which does not accord with their well-documented animosity.

'''Ian Keith Harris''' (Born June 24 1935), is a [[composer]] of [[classical music]], [[Arrangement|arranger]], [[oboist]] and [[Music education|music educator]] from [[Australia]].

==Biography==

Ian Keith Harris was born<ref name=""biogrph"">The biography is based upon the preface by [[Jennifer Paull]] to [http://icking-music-archive.org/scores/harris/Interlude/Autumnal-Interlude.pdf 'Autumnal Interlude'] published in [[Werner Icking Music Archive]] and upon biographic information provided by Ian Keith Harris.</ref> in [[Melbourne]], living there for the first 26 years of his life. He started the piano at the age of five, was playing cornet in his school band, then violin for a couple of years at high school, and later was school pianist. in 1952, he began his Bachelor of Music degree at [[Melbourne University]] [[College or university school of music|Conservatorium of Music]] taking piano as chief study and oboe as second. He interrupted his studies and served some years as oboist for [[J. C. Williamson|J. C. Williamson theatres]], playing [[Musical theatre|musicals]], [[opera]], and several [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] Opera seasons, several ballet seasons ([[The Australian Ballet|Borovansky Ballet]]), Australian tours of the [[Royal Opera House|Royal Covent Garden Ballet]], and the [[New York City Ballet|American Ballet Company]], and as a [[copyist]] / arranger with [[GTV]] channel 9. In 1961 Ian Harris moved to [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]] ([[Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra]]), was seconded to the [[Sydney Symphony|Sydney Symphony Orchestra]] ([[Cor anglais (English horn)|cor anglais]]) for several months, returned to Tasmania only to be seconded again 1964, this time to the [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra|Victorian Symphony Orchestra]] (oboe). Back again in Tasmania, his next move was to [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]] (1965–1974) to join NZBCSO (the [[New Zealand Symphony Orchestra|New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation Symphony Orchestra]]) as Principal Cor anglais. During this time, in which he yo-yoed across Australasia, Harris tutored in oboe at the universities of Tasmania, Melbourne, and the [[Victoria University of Wellington]]. It was at the latter that he completed his degree in [[Musical composition|composition]] (with [[David Farquhar (composer)|David Farquhar]]) in 1969. He was to return yet again to Tasmania at the end of 1974. However, this time, he embraced a new career as a music educator with his move. He also conducted the Tasmanian Junior Youth Orchestra for several years.

Later he changed to oboe as his chief study and studied [[Musical composition|composition]] with Arthur Nickson. he was soon in demand as a free-lance orchestral musician, arranger and copyist, working in a very eclectic mix of musical spheres from arranging for [[Eartha Kitt]] (television and various theatrical shows), to playing in [[opera]], [[ballet]], [[chamber music]] and [[symphony orchestra]]s. He was a founding member of the Glendenian Trio, ([[flute]], [[oboe]], [[bassoon]]), which gave regular broadcasts over several years. The trio was another area in which his skills at arrangement were frequently employed.

Harris was a dedicated member of policy committees, especially in Education and the Arts and served as music critic for [[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]], Hobart's daily newspaper, for several years.

Ian Harris moved back to Sydney definitively in 2000 and has since devoted to composition.

==Works==

Ian Keith Harris destroyed most of his early compositions on completion, ""never satisfied in their worth"".

His oeuvre consists mainly of chamber music, much of which has been performed and broadcast: ''Microsymphony'' for Cor anglais Quartet (cor anglais, [[string trio]]), ''Oboe Quartet'' (oboe, string trio), ''Essay'' for Bassoon and Strings, ''Sonata for [[Viola]] and [[Piano]]'', amongst many other pieces and numerous arrangements for broadcasts and concerts.

His sense of fun has shown in many of his compositions including, ''A Piece with Strawberry Jam'', ''The Little Dog's Day'' ([[Rupert Brooke]]), ''Paw de Trois'' (for [[Wind quintet|Wind Quintet]], with movements dedicated to his pets by name), ''The Whitebait Fishers'' ­ ""A sort of [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]-like spoof for [[harpsichord]], [[string quartet]] and small choir, for which the producer of the hour-long national radio show penned the libretto for this, a special anniversary broadcast of the programme.""<ref name=""whitebait"">composer's notes</ref>

Harris orchestrated songs for symphony concerts, including a version of ''[[The Last Rose of Summer]]'' for [[Rita Streich]] (1920–1987). He also wrote, directed and even performed in advertising [[jingle|jingles]], playing [[celesta]], oboe, cor anglais or whatever was required.

'''Hajnal Ban''' (also known as '''Hajnal Black''') is an Australian author, right wing politician and convicted of charges that prevent her being elected to public office for four years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/hajnal-black-found-guilty/story-e6freoof-1226311101288|title=Hajnal Black fined $5000 after being found guilty of four charges relating to pecuniary interests|last=Baskin|first=Brooke|date=27 March 2012|work=couriermail.com.au|accessdate=20 July 2012}}</ref> She was  elected 15 March 2008 a councillor for [[Logan City]] but was disqualified from 27 March 2012. Previously she was a councillor for the (now defunct) [[Shire of Beaudesert|Beaudesert Shire]] Council from 27 March 2004. She was an unsuccessful [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] candidate for the federal seat of [[Division of Forde|Forde]], south of Brisbane, at the 2007 federal election. She won [[Liberal National Party of Queensland|Liberal National Party]] selection for the newly-created federal seat of [[Division of Wright|Wright]] in November 2009 but subsequently lost endorsement following allegations that she mismanaged the funds of a 65-year-old man.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/hajnal-bans-federal-election-bid-in-doubt-after-funds-allegations/story-e6freoof-1225876663785|title=Hajnal Ban's federal election bid in doubt after funds allegations|last=Sandy|first=Alison|coauthors=Chalmers, Emma|date=7 June 2010|work=couriermail.com.au|accessdate=7 June 2010}}</ref> She had meantime openly acknowledged that she was backed by the Australian TEA Party (and [[English Defence League|Australian Defence League]], ADL, group) with David Goodridge<ref>Massola, James 16 September 2010, ""Tea Party comes to Australia"" http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/capital-circle/tea-party-comes-to-australia/story-fn59nqgy-1225924785030</ref>

In 2002 she underwent surgery to increase the length of each leg by 8&nbsp;cm. She published her experiences in the book ''God Made Me Small, Surgery Made Me Tall'' under the [[pseudonym]] Sara Vornamen. She also released a book called ''Her Secret''.<ref>http://www.borders.com.au/book/hajnal-ban-her-secret/7452437/</ref><ref>http://www.hajnalban.com/node/22</ref>

== Early life ==
Hajnal Ban was born in [[Afula]], [[Israel]], to [[Hungary|Hungarian]] parents.<ref>Vornamen, Sara (Hajnal Ban's pen name)(2003) ''God made small, surgery made me tall''. Vornamen Enterprises</ref> Ban's grandfather was an Eastern European [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor who moved the family to Israel in 1976 to escape communism.<ref name=""Laszlo"">Laszlo, Dr Tanka (editor) (2005) ''Ausztralia es Uj-Zealand Magyar Vilaga (in English - Hungarians in the Australian and New Zealand part of the world)''. Panarama Konyvek (in English - Panarama Books), pg 34 article titled ''Ban, Hajnal - Kepviselo, jogasz (in English political/representative)'' and ''Szeret masokon segiteni (in English - She likes to help others)''.  This is a Hungarian written A-Z of ''notable'' Hungarians from around the world.  This edition is for the Australia/New Zealand region</ref>  The family moved to [[Austria]] in 1980 and then immigrated to [[Logan City]], south of [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]] in 1983.  On gaining pre-selection for a Federal seat, Ban relinquished her Israeli citizenship as [[Section 44 of the Australian Constitution]] forbids the election of people holding dual citizenship to its parliament.

== Education ==
Ban was educated at [[Marsden, Queensland|Marsden]] Primary School and then [[Marsden State High School]] in [[Logan City]], graduating in 1995. After high school she entered [[Griffith University|Griffith University's]] [[Griffith Law School|law school]] and completed a double degree in Law and International Business. Ban was then admitted as a Barrister-at-Law in 2001.<ref name=""Laszlo""/>

== Leg lengthening surgery ==
In 2002 Ban undertook radical cosmetic surgery to gain 8&nbsp;cm of height. She travelled to the [[Russian Ilizarov Scientific Center for Restorative Traumatology and Orthopaedics]] in [[Kurgan, Kurgan Oblast|Kurgan]], Russia where she was operated on by Dr Constantine Novikov.<ref>Vornamen, Sara (Hajnal Ban's pen name)(2003) ''God made small, surgery made me tall''. Vornamen Enterprises, pg 19</ref><ref>[[Who (magazine)|Who]] (18 May 2009) ''Extreme measures''. Pacific Magazines, pg 24</ref>
 
Over a period of 5 months Ban was bedridden as her legs were lengthened. The process of lengthening took 12 months.  She returned to Australia and talked to the media about her operation under the pseudonym Sara Vornamen in an attempt to hide her identity.  Under the name 'Sara Vornamen' Hajnal Ban wrote a book about her surgery, ''God made me small, Surgery made me Tall''.<ref name=""Calligeros -1"">{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/big-op-overcomes-small-anxiety-siberian-surgeons-add-8cms-20090429-amfy.html?page=-1|title=Big op overcomes small anxiety: Siberian surgeons add 8cms|last=Calligeros|first=Marissa  |date=29 April 2009|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/World/Mad-Mad-World/God-made-me-small-surgery-made-me-tall/articleshow/4467545.cms|title=God made me small, surgery made me tall|date=30 April 2009|work=Times of India|accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref>

Brisbane's [[The Courier-Mail|Courier-Mail]] revealed in April 2009 that Ban was actually Sara Vornamen.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,,25399893-23272,00.html|title=Hajnal Ban has legs broken to be 8cm taller|last=Sandy|first=Alison|date=29 April 2009|work=The Courier-Mail|accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref>  Since that time Ban has received world wide attention for her surgery<ref>{{cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/article6196646.ece|title=Australian councillor, Hajnal Ban, has legs broken to become taller|last=Tedmanson|first=Sophie|date=1 May 2009|work=Times Online|accessdate=2009-05-31 | location=London}}</ref> and has been a commentator on issues from sex-discrimination to extra airline charges.<ref>Robertson, Josh (23 May 2009) ''Giving hot girls a leg up''. The Courier Mail, pg 72</ref>

==Personal life== 

Ban made no secret of her relationship with Russell Tacon.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/hajnal-ban-says-she-owes-it-all-to-mentor-russell-tacon/story-e6freq7o-1225875670155|title=Hajnal Ban says she owes it all to mentor Russell Tacon|date=4 June 2010|work=The Courier Mail|accessdate=2010-08-03}}</ref>

Ban married Logan City Councillor [[Sean Black]] at [[Tamborine Mountain]] on 30 May 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/hajnal-ban-sean-black-marry-in-mt-tambourine-ceremony/story-e6freoof-1225873200589|title=Hajnal Ban, Sean Black marry in Mt Tamborine ceremony|last=Sandy|first=Alison|date=30 May 2010|work=The Courier-Mail|accessdate=2010-06-01}}</ref> Black has acted as her campaign manager.

== Political career ==
=== 2004 - 2008, Shire of Beaudesert Council ===

Hajnal Ban was first elected as Councillor for Division 4 in the former Shire of Beaudesert on 27 March 2004 at the age of 26 where she significantly outpolled her four male opponents.<ref>Flack, Mark (26 October 2007). ''Ban believes people contact is key to electoral success''. Albert and Logan News, p. 14</ref>  She was the youngest ever councillor to be elected in the shire and the only Barrister. She was elected to council as an independent and had no previous political party affiliation.  She joined the National Party in 2006.   

She was Chairperson of the Shire's Planning and Development Committee from April 2004, until December 2005 when she was removed from the post, a move spearheaded by Councillor John Fronis, over her opposition to the State's decision to designate the North McLean Enterprise Precinct in the [[South East Queensland]] Regional Plan, which would have placed heavy industry in the middle of her rural residential division.<ref>Waters, Brenton (12 December 2005) ''Ban-ished!''. Jimboomba Times, pg 5</ref>

=== 2007 Federal election ===

In the November 2007 [[Australian federal election, 2007|Federal Election]] Ban stood as the National Party candidate for the seat of Forde.<ref>Jacobson, Micheal (10–11 November 2007) ""Long-standing MPs to sit out"". Weekend Bulletin, pg 58</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/happy-national-breaks-the-mould/2006/10/25/1161749190650.html|title=Happy National breaks the mould|last=Coorey|first=Phillip  |date=26 October 2006|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=2009-06-01}}</ref>   Although she worked hard at her campaign<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22794635-5006786,00.html|title=Libs lose faith and turn to Nats|last=McKenna|first=Michael|date=21 November 2007|work=The Australian|accessdate=2009-05-31}}</ref> and was credited with achieving a larger than expected swing, Ban only achieved 12.2% of the primary vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/Website/HouseDivisionFirstPrefs-13745-162.htm|title=House of Representatives - Forde (2007 general election)|date=11 December 2007|publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]|accessdate=2009-05-31}}</ref>  The Forde electorate's voter base is heavily urban, so it was always unlikely the electorate would have voted for a National Party candidate over their urban Conservative sister party, the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberals]].

=== 2008 Local Government Elections ===

In July 2007, the Queensland [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] [[Government of Queensland|Government]] announced widespread [[Local Government Reform Commission|reform to local government]].  The major reform was to amalgamate many councils, and Beaudesert was included in the process.  Half of the Shire was amalgamated with the [[Shire of Boonah]] to create the [[Scenic Rim Region]] while the other half was amalgamated with Logan City.  Hajnal Ban's entire division was in the transferring area to be amalgamated into Logan City.  Her division underwent significant change as it was merged with the neighbouring Division 5 (held by John Fronis, a Labor councillor) to form the new Logan City Division 11. Fronis and Ban subsequently contested the new division at the March 2008 elections, with Ban winning convincingly, even in areas where the Labor vote at state and federal elections has historically been high. Ban achieved 66.06% of the two-candidate-preferred vote to John Fronis' 33.94%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecq.qld.gov.au/elections/local/lg2008/LoganCity/results/councillor/booth11.html|title=2008 Logan City - Councillor Election - Division 11|date=7 April 2008|publisher=Electoral Commission of Queensland|accessdate=2009-05-31}}</ref>

=== Post 2008 election ===
After her election to Logan City Hajnal Ban was elected Chairperson of the Community, Sport and Customer Services Committee but was removed from this position in May 2009 and replaced by a neighbouring urban based councillor, Phil Pidgeon, because of her strong and somewhat outspoken advocacy for the amalgamated areas she represents.<ref>Fraser, Kelmeny (24 May 2009) ''Council bars rebels''.  The Sunday Mail, pg 39</ref>

Ban formed an alliance with the only other Logan City rural councillor, Sean Black, in late 2008. Together they formed a strong allegiance in council advocating and representing their similar constituencies. Ban and Black married in 2010.

=== 2010 LNP candidacy for Wright ===
After questions were raised by Queensland’s Adult Guardian about her administration of an elderly man’s [[Estate (law)|estate]], the Liberal National Party revoked their endorsement of Ban as their candidate for the federal division of Wright on 7 June 2010.<ref>{{cite web|last=Maizey|first=Judith|title=Hajnal Ban dropped by LNP|url=http://albert-and-logan.whereilive.com.au/news/story/hajnal-ban-dropped-by-lnp/|accessdate=8 July 2010}}</ref> The LNP claim the Adult Guardian’s questions were never disclosed in her vetting committee. Ban voluntarily surrendered her Power of Attorney on 2 July 2010 after which proceedings in the [[Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal]] (QCAT) were ceased.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/politics/state-politics/ban-attacks-lnp-over-guardian-case/story-e6frgczx-1225888235879|title=Ban attacks LNP over guardian case|last=Barrett|first=Rosanne|date=6 July 2010|publisher = [[The Australian]]|accessdate=6 July 2010}}</ref>

Ban hit out at the Liberal National Party for taking pre-emptive action against her despite tribunal matters being settled within a month.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}} She went on to say men in the LNP hierarchy were never comfortable with a woman being preselected in a winnable seat.<ref>Fraser, Kelmeny (4 July 2010). ""Dumped for being a woman, says Hajnal"". ''The Sunday Mail'' (News Ltd), p. 10</ref> She had meantime openly acknowledged that she was backed by the Australian TEA Party (and Australian Defence League, ADL, group) with David Goodridge<ref>Massola, James 16 September 2010, ""Tea Party comes to Australia"" http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/capital-circle/tea-party-comes-to-australia/story-fn59nqgy-1225924785030</ref>

2012 Logan Council Election

Hajnal originally nominated to run again as councillor for Division 11, but several weeks prior to the election she withdrew from the contest.
As of the 28th of April 2012, she is unemployed and most likely, completely unemployable, due to the criminal convictions she has accrued over the course of 2012.

=== Policies on Gaming Machines ===

Hajnal Ban is an anti-[[Slot machine|pokies]] campaigner and continues to advocate for the reduction in the number of gaming machines within the Logan City local government area.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://logan-west-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/ban-moves-on-greenbank-tavern-pokie-plan/|last=Maizey|first=Judith|title=Ban moves on Greenbank Tavern pokie plan|date=16 June 2009|work=Albert & Logan News|accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref> Ban voted prominently in several ballots to remove Deputy Mayor of Logan, Russell Lutton, who is a pro-pokies councillor.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/lions-slot-new-venue-into-queenslands-poker-machine-capital-20090429-anaq.html|last=Barrett|first=Chris|title=Lions slot new venue into Queensland's poker machine capital|date=29 April 2009|work=Brisbanetimes.com.au|accessdate=2010-03-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://albert-and-logan.whereilive.com.au/news/story/council-out-on-a-limb/|last=Helbig|first=Koren|title=Council out on limb|date=1 May 2009|work=Albert & Logan News|accessdate=2009-06-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.logan.qld.gov.au/LCC/logan/news/Current/N090316decisionisaboutgivingresidents.htm|last=Lutton|first=Russell|title=Decision is about giving residents a choice|date=16 March 2009|work=Logan City press release obtained from LCC website|accessdate=2010-02-03}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,25138847-952,00.html|last=Davies|first=Hannah|title=Logan City moves to ban poker machines|date=4 March 2009|work=Courier Mail|accessdate=2010-02-03}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  Lutton has since fought back criticising Ban, including references to her leg lengthening story.<ref name=""Calligeros -1""/><ref>Robertson, Josh (5 May 2009) ''Tall tales at Logan circus''.

=== Criminal charges ===
{{update|Criminal charges|date=July 2012}} 
In November 2011, Black faced criminal charges for allegedly breaching local government financial disclosure laws. In December 2011, a Brisbane judge found that she had failed to act properly on behalf of a dementia patient after the sale of his Park Ridge property south of Brisbane. The funds from the sale had been transferred into her own bank account instead of being held in a separate trust account.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-12-07/court-rules-against-councillor-in-2413m-dispute/3718778|title=Court rules against councillor in $1.3m dispute|publisher=ABC Online|date=7 December 2011}}</ref> Black lodged an appeal against the decision of the Supreme court in January 2012, the case has yet to be set down for mention.  She has had two warrants issued for her arrest in March 2012, for ignoring a court date and storming out of another. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/hajnal-black-diagnosed-with-laryngitis-as-warrant-for-her-arrest-remains-active/story-e6freoof-1226304034309|title=Hajnal Black on move to Brisbane Court of Appeal as warrant for her arrest remains active|publisher=Courier Mail|date=19 March 2012}}</ref> On 27 March 2012 she was found guilty on four of the five charges, fined $3500 and ordered to pay costs of $5000 and had a conviction recorded.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/hajnal-black-found-guilty/story-e6freoof-1226311101288|title=Hajnal Black found guilty|publisher=Courier Mail|date=27 March 2012}}</ref> Black has 28 days to appeal that verdict. {{update after|2012|7|20}}

{{For|the later development of this god|Shiva}}

'''Rudra''' ({{lang-sa|रुद्रः}}) is a [[Rigvedic deities|Rigvedic god]] of the storm,<ref>For Rudra as a storm god, see: Basham (1989), p. 15.</ref> the wind, and the hunt. The name has been translated as ""Roarer"",<ref>Zimmer (172), p. 181.</ref><ref>Majumdar, p. 162.</ref><ref>Griffith, p. 75, note 1.</ref> ""Howler"",<ref>Zimmer (1972), p. 181.</ref>  ""Wild One"", and ""Terrible"". Rudra is ""thought"" to be an early form of [[Shiva]]. <ref>For Rudra as a Vedic form of Shiva, see: Zimmer (1972), p. 181.</ref> By the time that the [[Ramayana]] was written, the name ''Rudra'' is taken as a synonym for Shiva and the two names are used interchangeably.
 
==Etymology==

The etymology of the word ''rudra'' is somewhat uncertain.<ref>For etymology of ''rudra'' being uncertain, see: Chakravarti, p. 4.</ref>  The commentator [[Sayana|{{IAST|Sāyaṇa}}]] suggests six possible derivations for the word.<ref>For {{IAST|Sāyaṇa}} suggesting six possible derivations see: Chakravarti, p. 5.</ref>  However, another reference states that Sayana suggested ten derivations. <ref> see: Sri Rudram and Purushasukram,by Swami Amiritananda, pgs. 9-10, Sri Ramakrishna Math .</ref>

The Sanskrit name ''Rudra'' is usually derived from the root ''rud-'' which means ""to cry, howl.""<ref>For the ""usual"" derivation from root ''rud-'' meaning ""to cry"" see: Chakravarti, p. 4.</ref><ref>For ''rud-'' meaning ""cry, howl"" as a traditional etymology see: Kramrisch, p. 5.</ref>  According to this etymology, the name Rudra has been translated as ""the Roarer"".<ref>For root ''rud-'' as the basis of translation of the name ''Rudra'' as ""the Roarer"" see: Majumdar, p. 162.</ref>  An alternate etymology suggested by Prof. Pischel derives ''Rudra'' (""the Red, the Brilliant"") from a lost root ''rud-'', ""to be red""<ref>Griffith, p. 75, note 1.</ref> or ""to be ruddy"",<ref>For the Pischel etymology as ""ruddy"" see: Chakravarti, p. 4.</ref> or according to Grassman, ""to shine"".<ref>For Grassman's hypothetical ''rud-'' meaning ""to shine"" see: Chakravarti, p. 4.</ref> Stella Kramrisch notes a different etymology connected with the adjectival form ''raudra'', which means wild, of ''rudra'' nature, and translates the name ''Rudra'' as ""the Wild One"" or ""the Fierce God"".<ref>Citation to M. Mayrhofer, ''Concise Etymological Sanskrit Dictionary'', ''s.v.'' ""rudra"", is provided in: Kramrisch, p. 5.</ref> R. K. Sharma follows this alternate etymology and translates the name as ""Terrible"" in his glossary for the Shiva Sahasranama.<ref>Sharma, p. 301.</ref> 

The adjective ''shiva'' in the sense of ""propitious"" or ""kind"" is applied to the name Rudra in Rig Veda 10.92.9.<ref>Kramrisch, p. 7.</ref><ref>For text of RV 10.92.9 ''see:'' Arya and Joshi, volume 4, p. 432.</ref> According to Gavin Flood, ''Shiva'' used as a name or title (Sanskrit ''{{IAST|śiva}}'', ""the kindly/auspicious one"") occurs only in the late Vedic ''Katha Aranyaka''<ref>Flood (2003), p. 73.</ref>  Axel Michaels says ''Rudra'' was called ''Shiva'' for the first time in the ''[[Shvetashvatara Upanishad|Śvetāśvatara Upanishad]]''.<ref>Michaels, p. 217.</ref> 

Rudra is called ""The Archer"" (Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|Śarva}}'')<ref>For {{IAST|Śarva}} as a name of Shiva see: Apte, p. 910.</ref> and the arrow is an essential attribute of Rudra.<ref>For archer and arrow associations see Kramrisch, Chapter 2, and for the arrow as an ""essential attribute"" see: Kramrisch, p. 32.</ref> This name appears in the Shiva Sahasranama, and R. K. Sharma notes that it is used as a name of Shiva often in later languages.<ref>Sharma, p. 306.</ref>  The word is derived from the Sanskrit root ''{{IAST|śarv}}-'' which means ""to injure"" or ""to kill""<ref>For root ''{{IAST|śarv}}-'' see: Apte, p. 910.</ref> and Sharma uses that general sense in his interpretive translation of the name {{IAST|Śarva}} as ""One who can kill the forces of darkness"".<ref>Sharma, p. 306.</ref>  The names {{IAST|Dhanvin}} (""Bowman"")<ref>Chidbhavananda, p. 33.</ref> and {{IAST|Bāṇahasta}} (""Archer"", literally ""Armed with arrows in his hands"")<ref>Chidbhavananda, p. 33.</ref><ref>For translation of {{IAST|Bāṇahasta}} as ""Armed with arrows in his hands"") see: Sharma, p. 294.</ref> also refer to archery. 

In other contexts the word ''rudra'' can simply mean ""the number eleven"".<ref>Apte, p. 804</ref>

The word ""[[rudraksha]]"" (Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|rudrākşa}}'' = ''rudra'' + ''{{IAST|akşa}}'' ""eye""), or ""eye of Rudra"", is used as a name both for the berry of the Rudraksha tree, and a name for a string of the prayer beads made from those seeds.<ref>For compound ''rudra'' + ''{{IAST|akşa}}'' and two meanings of the compound term, see: Apte, p. 804.</ref>

==The Maruts==

Rudra is used both as a name of Shiva and collectively (""the Rudras"") as the name for the [[Maruts]].<ref>For the terms ""Maruts"" and ""Rudras"" as equivalent, see: Flood (1996), p. 46.</ref>  Gavin Flood characterizes the Maruts as ""storm gods"", associated with the atmosphere.<ref>Flood (1996), pp. 45-46.</ref>  They are a group of gods, supposed to be either eleven or thirty-three<ref>For the number of Maruts as either 11 or 33 see: Macdonell, p. 256.</ref> in number.  The number of Maruts varies from two to sixty (three times sixty in RV 8.96.8.).{{Fact|date=June 2007}}
 
The Rudras are sometimes referred to as ""the sons of Rudra"".<ref>Flood (1996), p. 46.</ref> Rudra is referred to as ""Father of the Maruts"" in RV 2.33.1.<ref>For ""Father of the Maruts"" in RV 2.33.1 see: Arya and Joshi, vol. 2, p. 78.</ref><ref>For Shiva as the head or father of the group see: Apte, p. 804.</ref><ref>For Rudra as the head of a host of ""storm spirits, the Maruts"" see: Basham (1989), p. 14.</ref>

==Rig Veda==

The earliest mentions of Rudra occur in the Rig Veda, where three entire hymns are devoted to him.<ref>For three RV hymns devoted to Rudra, see: Chakravarti, p. 1.</ref><ref>For citation of the four Rig Veda hymns (1.43, 1.114, 2.33, and 7.46) see: Michaels, p. 216 and p. 364, note 50.</ref> There are about seventy-five references to Rudra in the Rig Veda overall.<ref>For seventy-five RV mentions, see: Chakravarti, p. 1.</ref><ref>E.g., Rudra is included in a litany given in RV 7.40.5.</ref>  In the [[Rig Veda]] Rudra's role as a frightening god is apparent in references to him as ''ghora'' (""terrible""), or simply as ''asau devam'' (""that god"").<ref>Flood (2003), p, 73.</ref> He is ""fierce like a formidable wild beast"" (RV 2.33.11).<ref>For translation of RV 2.33.11 as ""fierce like a formidable wild beast"" see: Arya and Joshi, vol. 2, p. 81.</ref>  Chakravarti sums up the perception of Rudra by saying:

{{Quotation|Rudra is thus regarded with a kind of cringing fear, as a deity whose wrath is to be deprecated and whose favor curried.<ref>Chakravarti, p. 8.</ref>}}

RV 1.114 is an appeal to Rudra for mercy, where he is referred to as ""mighty Rudra, the god with braided hair.""<ref>Doniger, pp. 224-225</ref>

In Rig Veda 7.46, Rudra is described as armed with a bow and fast-flying arrows. As quoted by R. G. Bhandarkar, the hymn says Rudra discharges ""brilliant shafts which run about the heaven and the earth"" (RV 7.46.3), which may be a reference to the destructive power of lightning.<ref>For RV 7.46.3 as symbolic of lightning, see: Bhandarkar, p. 146.</ref>

Rudra was believed to cause disease, and when people recovered from them or were free of them, that too was attributed to the agency of Rudra.<ref>For association between Rudra and disease, with Rig Vedic references, see: Bhandarkar, p. 146.</ref>  He is asked not to afflict children with disease (RV 7.46.2) and to keep villages free of illness (RV 1.114.1).  He is said to have healing remedies (RV 1.43.4), as the best physician of physicians (RV 2.33.4), and as possessed of a thousand medicines (RV 7.46.3).

===Rig Veda 7.40.5===

Rudra is mentioned along with a litany of other deities in Rig Veda 7.40.5.  Here is the reference to Rudra, whose name appears as one of many gods who are called upon:

<blockquote>
This ''{{IAST|Varuṇa}}'', the leader of the rite, and the royal ''Mitra'' and ''Aryaman'', uphold my acts, and the divine unopposed ''Aditi'', earnestly invoked: may they convey us safe beyond evil.

I propitiate with oblations the ramifications ({{IAST|vayāḥ}}) of that divine attainable ''{{IAST|Viṣṇu}}'', the showerer of benefits. ''Rudra'', bestow upon us the magnificence of his nature.  The ''{{IAST|Aśvins}}'' have come down to our dwelling abounding with (sacrificial) food.<ref>RV 7.40.4 - 7.40.5 as translated in Arya and Joshi, pp. 243-244.</ref>
</blockquote>

One scholiast interpretation of the Sanskrit word ''{{IAST|vayāḥ}}'', meaning ""ramifications"" or ""branches"", is that all other deities are, as it were branches of Vishnu,<ref>For the scholiast interpretation of ''{{IAST|vayāḥ}}'' as ""ramifications"" or ""branches"" see: Arya and Joshi, p. 244.</ref> but Ralph T. H. Griffith cites Ludwig as saying ""This... gives no satisfactory interpretation"" and cites other views which suggest that the text is corrupt at that point.<ref>See: ""This, Ludwid remarks, gives no satisfactory interpretation; but I am unable to offer anything better at present. Grassman alters {{IAST|vayāḥ}} into {{IAST|vayāma}}: 'we with our offering approach the banquet of this swift-moving God, the bounteous {{IAST|Viṣṇu}}; i.e. come to offer him sacrificial food.'"" in: Griffith, p. 356, note 5.</ref>

==Hymns==

{{For|more information on Rudra hymns|Shri Rudram Chamakam}}

Besides the few passages to Rudra in the ''Rig Veda'', there are important hymns in the collections of the Atharva Veda.  In the various recensions of the Yajur Veda is included a litany of stanzas praising Rudra: (''Maitrāyaṇī-Saṃhitā'' 2.9.2, ''Kāṭhaka-Saṃhitā'' 17.11, ''Taittirīya-Saṃhitā'' 4.5.1, and ''Vājasaneyi-Saṃhitā'' 16.1–14).  This litany is subsequently referred to variously as the ''Śatarudriyam'', the ''Namakam'' (because many of the verses commence with the word ''namaḥ'' [`homage`]), or simply the ''Rudram''.  This litany was recited during the ''[[agnicayana]]'' ritual (""the piling of Agni""), and it later became a standard element in Rudra liturgy.

A selection of these stanzas, augmented with others, is included in the ''Paippalāda-Saṃhitā'' of the Atharva Veda (PS 14.3—4).  This selection, with further PS additions at the end, circulated more widely as the ''Nīlarudram'' (or ''Nīlarudra Upaniṣad'').<ref>See Lubin 2007</ref><ref>For an overview of the Śatarudriya see: Kramrisch, pp. 71-74.</ref>

==Dasam Granth==

The 10th Sikh Guru, [[Guru Gobind Singh]] describes the [[incarnation]] of Lord Shiva in his book the [[Dasam Granth]], the Canto is titled Rudra [[Avatar]]

== A possible Hellenic equivalent to Rudra ==
In the 2nd verse of [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv01114.htm ''Ṛc Veda'' 1:114], along with Rudra is mentioned Manu : this /MANu/ may be the etymological equivalent to the /MANēs/ who is described by Hērodotos as the grandfather, and by Dionusios of Halikarnassos as the great-grandfather, of Ludos. If so, then /LUDos/  would be the Hellenic etymological equivalent to /RUDra/. (The Indo-european phoneme /L/ is regularly changed to /R/ in the Samskṛta language.) The name of the goddess /ADIti/, mentioned with Rudra in the 2nd verse of [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv01043.htm ''Ṛc Veda'' 1:43], may be compared with the name /ADIēs/ of the uncle of Ludos according to Dionusios of Halikarnassos.
According to the [http://www.khandro.net/deity_tale_of_two.htm ''Golden Rosary of Padma-Sambhava''], at the birth of Rudra there appeared 18 inauspicious signs along with famine : this matches the 18 years of famine (according to [http://www.iranchamber.com/history/herodotus/herodotus_history_book1.php Hērodotos : ''Kliōi''] 94) in the reign of Atus the father of Ludos.

==In modern fiction== 

*Rudra appears alongside [[Agni]] in [[Devil May Cry 3]] as a pair of twin swords with Rudra possessing the element of wind and Agni possessing the element of fire. The two demonic swords frequently speak to each other, much to the annoyance of the character Dante.

'''J. Woodland (“Woody”) Hastings''' (born on March 24, 1927 in New Jersey) is a leader in the field of [[photobiology]], especially [[bioluminescence]], and is one of the founders of the field of circadian biology ([[circadian rhythms]]).  He is the Paul C. Mangelsdorf Professor of Natural Sciences (Emeritus) in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology at [[Harvard University]].<ref>http://golgi.harvard.edu/hastings/dino.html</ref><ref>http://mcb.harvard.edu/hastings/Images/woody.html</ref>  He has published over 400 papers and co-edited three books. 

Hastings research on bioluminescence has principally focused on bacterial luminescence (over 150 papers) and [[dinoflagellates]] (over 80 papers).  In addition to bacteria and dinoflagellates, he, with his students and colleagues, has published papers on the biochemical and molecular mechanisms of light production in  [[fungi]], [[cnidarians]], [[ctenophore]]s, [[polychaetes]], [[insects]] ([[fireflies]] and [[dipterans]]), [[ostracod]] crustaceans, [[millipedes]], [[tunicates]], and [[fishes]] with bacterial light organs.  His laboratory produced: 1) the first evidence for [[quorum sensing]] in bacteria (initially involving luminescent proteins, but has since expanded to bacterial [[toxins]] and other products), <ref> Hastings, J.W. and Greenberg, E.P. (1999)</ref> 2) early evidence of the molecular mechanisms of circadian clock regulation in organisms (first using dinoflagellate luminescence and then expanded to other cellular proteins), <ref> Sweeney, B.M. and Hastings, J.W. (1957)</ref><ref> Hastings, J.W. (2007)</ref> and 3) some of the initial studies of energy transfer in [[green fluorescent protein]]s (GFP) in [[cnidarian]] luminescence. <ref> Morin, J.G. and Hastings, J.W. (1971)</ref><ref> Hastings, J.W. and Morin, J.G. (2006)</ref>

Hastings has received numerous awards including: Elected to the [[National Academy of Sciences]], 2003; Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], 1972; Fellow of the [[American Academy of Microbiology]], 2003; [http://www.pol-us.net/ASP_Home/awards.html American Society for Photobiology, Lifetime Achievement Award], 2003; [http://sleep.med.harvard.edu/what-we-do/farrell-prize-in-sleep-medicine Farrell Prize in Sleep Medicine] for his work on circadian rhythms, 2006; Elected to the [http://www.jhu.edu/commencement/honorary/scholall.shtml Johns Hopkins Society of Scholars], 1969; [http://www.gf.org/about-the-foundation/the-fellowship/ Guggenheim Fellow], 1965; NATO Senior Fellow in Science, Foundation Curie, Orsay, France, 1977; [http://www.humboldt-foundation.de/web/home.html Alexander von Humboldt Fellow], Germany 1979, 1993; [http://www.yamadazaidan.jp/english/overview.html Yamada Foundation Fellow], Osaka, Japan, 1986; [http://www.nimh.nih.gov/index.shtml NIMH Merit Award], 1990; 1994

==His Career==
'''1948-1951''': Hastings began his graduate studies at [[Princeton University]] (Princeton, NJ) in 1948 in the laboratory of E. Newton Harvey, the world leader of luminescence studies at the time, and focused on the role of oxygen in the luminescence of bacteria, fireflies, ostracod crustaceans and fungi.  He received his PhD in 1951. 

'''1951-1953''': He then joined the lab of William D. McElroy, another student of Harvey’s, at [[Johns Hopkins University]] (Baltimore, MD) where he discovered both the stimulatory effects of [[coenzyme A]] and gating control by [[oxygen]] of firefly luminescence, and that [[flavin]] is a substrate in bacterial luminescence. 

'''1953-1957''': In 1953 he joined the faculty in the Department of Biological Sciences at [[Northwestern University]] (Evanston, IL). In 1954 he began a long collaboration with Beatrice Sweeney, who was then at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] (La Jolla, CA), in elucidating the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of luminescence in the unicellular dinoflagellate ''Lingulodinium polyedrum'' (formerly ''Gonyaulax polyedra''). A byproduct of this initial research was their discovery of circadian control of the luminescence. 

'''1957-1966''': Hastings next took a faculty position in the Biochemistry Division of the Chemistry Department at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] (Urbana, IL) where he continued his focus on dinoflagellate and bacterial luminescence and dinoflagellate circadian rhythms.  

'''1966-present''': Hastings joined the faculty of Harvard University as Professor of Biology in 1966 and where he remains as an emeritus professor.  During this period he continued and expanded his studies of circadian rhythms in dinoflagellates and luminescence in bacteria, dinoflagellates and other organisms. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2003<ref>http://www.pnas.org/content/104/3/693.full.pdf</ref> and received the Farrell Prize in Sleep Medicine for his work on circadian rhythms in 2006.<ref> http://golgi.harvard.edu/NewsEvents/News/Hastings.html</ref><ref>http://sleep.med.harvard.edu/what-we-do/farrell-prize-in-sleep-medicine/recipients/Hastings-2006</ref>

For over 50 years he has also had an affiliation with the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] in Woods Hole, MA.  He was the director of the Physiology Course there from 1962-.1966, and served as a trustee from 1966-1970.

==Research Interests==

'''Luminescent Bacteria''': Hastings investigations of luminous bacteria have led not only to basic discoveries of the biochemical mechanisms involved in their light production, the discovery of a flavin to be a substrate in its [[luciferase]] reaction, the determination of gene regulation of the luciferases, but also the first evidence for quorum sensing, a form of bacterial communication.  In quorum sensing (initially termed autoinduction), the bacteria release into the medium a substance, the autoinducer, that, once the concentration of this substance reaches a critical level, which is a measure of the number of bacteria in a limited area, [[transcription]] of specific other genes that had been repressed are turned on.  Once the sequenced autoinducer gene was found to occur widely in [[gram-negative bacteria]] quorum sensing became accepted in the early 1990s.  Now we know that, like the luciferase proteins, in many pathogenic bacteria there is delayed production of toxins, which serve to greatly augment their pathogenicity.  By curtailing their toxin output until the bacterial populations are substantial these bacteria can generate massive quantities of toxin quickly and thereby swamp the defenses of the host. 

'''Luminescent Dinoflagellates''': Beginning in 1954 at Northwestern University Hastings and his students and colleagues have been studying cellular and molecular aspects of bioluminescence in dinoflagellates [especially ''Lingulodinium polyedrum'' (formerly ''Gonyaulax polyedra'')].  They have been elucidating the structures of the [[luciferin]]s and [[luciferases]], the organization and regulation of their associated genes, temporal control mechanisms, and the actual subcellular identity and location of the light emitting elements, which they termed scintillons.  They demonstrated that the reaction is controlled by a drop in [[pH]] when an [[action potential]] leads to the entry of protons via voltage-activated membrane channels in the scintillons.  Through immunolocalization studies the Hastings lab showed that scintillons are small peripheral vesicles (0.4 μm) that contain both the luciferase and the luciferin-binding protein.  Recently their lab has found that the luciferase gene in ''Lingulodinium polyedrum'' and other closely related species contains three homologous and contiguous repeated sequences in a kind of “three-ring circus with the same act in all three.”  However, another luminescent, but [[heterotrophic]], dinoflagellate, ''Noctiluca scintillans'', has but a single protein, which appears to possess both catalytic and substrate binding properties in a single, rather than separate proteins.

'''Dinoflagellate Circadian Rhythms''':  Using ''Lingulodinium polyedrum'' as a model, Hastings has spear-headed our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in control of circadian rhythms, which in humans are involved in sleep, jet-lag and other daily activities.  His lab has shown that the rhythm of bioluminescence involves a daily synthesis and destruction of proteins.  Because the [[mRNA]]s that code for these proteins remain unchanged from day to night, the synthesis of these proteins is controlled at the [[translational]] level.  This work has now been expanded to other proteins in the cell.  On the other hand, short pulses of inhibitors of synthesis of these proteins results in phase shifts of the circadian rhythm, either delays or advances, depending when the pulse is administered.  At still another level, [[protein phosphorylation]] inhibitors also influence the period of the rhythm. 

'''Other luminescent systems''': Early in his career Hastings developed techniques to quantify the level of oxygen required in a luminescent reaction for several different species including bacteria, fungi, fireflies and ostracod crustaceans.  This work showed that oxygen gating is the mechanism for firefly flashing. In other work when he was in the McElroy lab he examined the basic biochemical mechanism of firefly luciferase and demonstrated that coenzyme A stimulates light emission.  His lab first demonstrated that the green in vivo coelenterate bioluminescence occurs because of energy transfer from the luminescent molecule ([[aequorin]]), which alone emits blue light, to a secondary green emitter which they termed green fluorescent protein (GFP).  Once characterized and cloned, GFP has become a crucial molecule used as a reporter and tagging tool for studying gene activation and developmental patterns.  [[Osamu Shimomura]], [[Martin Chalfie]] and [[Roger Tsien]] received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 2008 for their work on this remarkable molecule.

'''''Amanita nothofagi''''' is a species of [[fungus]] in the [[Amanitaceae]] family. [[Endemism|Endemic]] to New Zealand, the species was first described by mycologist [[Greta Stevenson]] in 1962. The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] have dark brown [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that are up to {{convert|13|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter and covered with with patches of soft greyish-brown scales or warts. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] underneath the cap are crowded together, free from attachment to the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], and white, becoming tinged with yellow in age. The stem of the mushroom is {{convert|4|–|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|0.5|–|2.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, and has a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]]. The [[spore print]] is white, and individual spores are spherical to ellipsoid, measuring 7.5–9 by 7.5–9 [[micrometre]]s. The mushroom may be confused with another New Zealand species, ''[[Amanita australis|A.&nbsp;australis]]'', but can be distinguished by certain characteristics. ''Amanita nothofagi'' is a [[mycorrhiza]]l species, and grows in association with native New Zealand trees such as [[Southern Beech]].

==Taxonomy and classification==
The species was first described as new to science by New Zealand mycologist [[Greta Stevenson]] who collected specimens in the mid-1950s, in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] and [[Cape Farewell, New Zealand|Cape Farewell]]. She published a [[species description|description]] of the mushroom in the [[Royal Botanic Garden]]'s journal ''[[Kew Bulletin]]'' in 1962, the second part of a five-part series of articles describing the mushroom [[flora]] of the country. The [[specific epithet]] ''nothofagi'' refers to ''Nothofagus'', the genus of [[Southern beech]]es with which the species is often associated.<ref name=Stevenson1962/> ''Amanita'' authority Rodham Tulloss uses the [[common name]] ""southern beech Amanita"",<ref name=""urlAmanita nothofagi G. S. Ridl.""/> while [[Geoff Ridley]] suggests ""charcoal flycap"".<ref name=Ridley2004/>

Stevenson [[classification (biology)|classified]] ''Amanita nothofagi'' in the section ''Phalloideae'' of the genus ''[[Amanita]]'',<ref name=Stevenson1962/> but Ridley considered it better placed in section ''Validae'' because of its ""subglobose basidiospores, a clavate or occasionally abruptly bulbous stipe base, with sparse bands or a rim of volva material.""<ref name=Ridley1991/>

==Description==

}}
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''A.&nbsp;nothofagi'' is initially convex, later becoming flattened with a central depression, with radial grooves on the margin, reaching diameters of {{convert|30|–|130|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The colour is variable, ranging from [[buff (color)|buff]] to dark grey to greyish-[[sepia (color)|sepia]], with radial streaks of dusky brownish grey. The cap surface is sticky when young or wet, but dries out with age. The remnants of the [[volva (mycology)|volva]] form small to large, irregularly shaped, felted patches, that are dull greyish-sepia to sepia, and sometimes scab-like. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are crowded closely together, and free from attachment to the stem. They are white to cream-coloured, {{convert|6|–|10|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide. The lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stem) have somewhat truncated ends.<ref name=Ridley1991/>

The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|40|–|140|mm|in|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|5|–|25|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, and tapers slightly at the top. It is hollow and has a bulbous base measuring {{convert|10|–|30|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter. The stem surface above the level of the [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] is white, sparsely covered with woolly or fuzzy tufts, occasionally breaking into transverse bands; below the ring the stem surface is smooth or occasionally breaks into bands or [[wikt:fibrillose|fibrillose]] scales. It is whitish, buff or greyish-sepia streaked with grey. The stem base may or may not have a band or rim of buff to greyish-sepia volval remnants. The ring is membranous, grooved, whitish, buff, and greyish-sepia or lavender-grey. It first hangs freely before later sticking to the stem, often tearing and adhering to the edge of the cap. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] of the cap is white or stained mouse-grey under the central part, occasionally with a grey line above the gills; the stem flesh is white to pale buff.<ref name=Ridley1991/>

The [[spore print]] is white. The [[spore]]s are typically 7.5–9 by 7.5–9&nbsp;[[micrometre|µm]], spherical to broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid, and thin-walled. Under a [[light microscope|microscope]], the spores appear [[hyaline]] (translucent), and are amyloid—meaning they will turn bluish-black to black when [[staining|stained]] with [[Melzer's reagent]]. The [[basidia]] are 30.5–57 by 8–16&nbsp;µm, four-spored, and not clamped at the base. The margin cells of the gills are plentiful, spherical, club-shaped or swollen spherically at the tip, hyaline, and measure 13–58 by 8–33&nbsp;µm. The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] consists of a 130–220&nbsp;µm wide, strongly gelatinised suprapellis (upper layer) and a dense, non-gelatinised subpellis (lower layer). The volval remnants on the cap are made of abundant spherical, elliptic and club-shaped cells that are 21–119 by 14.5–115&nbsp;µm, intermixed with hyphae 4–9&nbsp;µm wide and pale umber in colour, and either arranged irregularly, or with a vertical orientation.<ref name=Ridley1991/>

''Amanita nothofagi'' mushrooms can be confused with ''[[Amanita australis|A.&nbsp;australis]]'' if the warts have been washed off and the colour has been bleached. A reliable method to distinguish the two is to check for the presence of clamp connections at the bases of the basidia, which are present in ''A.&nbsp;australis'' and absent from ''A.&nbsp;nothofagi''. Ridley notes that the type collection was made with a dark grey specimen, and later collectors who found browner specimens have had difficulty in correctly identifying the species. Paler specimens resemble ''[[Amanita excelsa|A.&nbsp;excelsa]]'', which led some to incorrectly believe that the species occurs in New Zealand. ''[[Amanita luteofusca]]'' is also similar in appearance, spore size, amyloid reaction, and lack of clamp connections in the basidia. It is distinguished from ''A.&nbsp;nothofagi'' largely on the basis of colour—it is a greyish-brown to yellowish-grey brown that fades to pinkish-buff as it gets older.<ref name=Ridley1991/> Tulloss suggests that the resemblance of a number of species from Australasia and Chile which lack brightly coloured fruit bodies and share similar greyish to brownish rings and volvas may indicate that they share [[Gondwana]]n ancestors.<ref name=""urlAmanita nothofagi G. S. Ridl.""/>

==Habitat and distribution==
The fruit bodies of ''Amanita nothofagi'' grow solitarily or in scattered groups. Like all ''Amanita'' mushrooms, it is [[mycorrhiza]]l, and grows in close association with [[Southern Beech]] (genus ''[[Nothofagus]]'') (including [[Nothofagus fusca|New Zealand Red Beech]], [[Silver beech]], [[Nothofagus solandri|New Zealand Black Beech]], and [[Hard Beech]]), ''[[Leptospermum scoparium|Manuka]]'', and ''[[Kunzea ericoides|Kānuka]]''. Found on both the North and South islands of New Zealand, it is the most common of the country's [[endemism|endemic]] ''Amanita'' species.<ref name=Ridley1991/>

18,b,Taoist sexual practices,taoism,"<div class=""floatright"">[[Image:Heqi.JPG|300px]]<br><small>An ancient Chinese print depicting 'The Joining of the Essences.'</small></div>

Daoist sexual practices (Simplified Chinese: 合气, Traditional Chinese: 合氣, pinyin: heqi) or ‘The Joining of the Essences,’ is the way Daoists practiced sex. The Daoists believed that by practicing these sexual arts, one could stay in good health, and eventually attain immortality. 

==History==

The first sexual texts that survive today are those found at the [[Mawangdui]] tombs. While Daoism had not yet fully evolved as a philosophy at this time, these texts share some remarcable similarities will later [[Tang dynasty]] texts, such as the [[Ishimpo]]. The sexual arts arguably reached their peak in between the end of the [[Han dynasty]] and the end of the Tang dynasty. After 1000 CE, Confucian puritanism became stronger and stronger, so that by the advent of the Qing dynasty, sex was a taboo topic. These Confucians alleged that the separation of sexes existed two thousand years ago, and suppressed the sexual arts. Because of the taboo surrounding sex, there was much censoring done during the Qing in literature, and the sexual arts died off. As a result, many of the texts survived only in [[Japan]], and scholars had no idea that such a different concept of sex existed in early China.

==Principles==

===Qi (Lifeforce)===
The basis of all Daoist thinking is that [[qi]] is part of everything that exists. Humans are born with only a finite amount of qi, and once all the qi has been lost, you will die. Qi could be lost from the body in a variety of ways, but was lost mostly through bodily fluids. Daoists would try to avoid losing as much bodily fluid as possible, and would sometimes recycle and compost their own fecal matter.<ref>Wile (1992), p. 6.</ref> The fluid that contained the most qi was male semen. Therefore the Daoists believed that men should avoid ejaculation in order to conserve their life essence.

===Male Control of Ejaculation===
Many Daoist practitioners link the loss of ejaculatory fluids to the loss of vital life force, where excessive fluid loss results in premature aging, disease, and general fatigue.  The more extreme Daoists contend that one should never [[ejaculate]], where others provide a specific formula to determine the maximum amount of regular [[ejaculations]].  The general idea is to limit the loss of fluids as much as possible to the level of your desired practice.  
As these sexual practices evolved over the centuries, the emphasis on limiting ejaculation became less important. Nevertheless, the 'retention of the semen' was one of the foundational tenets of Daoist sexual practice.

There are different methods to control ejaculation prescribed by the Daoists. In order to avoid ejaculation, the man could two things. He could pull out immediately before orgasm, a method which [[Joseph Needham]] termed ""coitus conservatus."" The second method involved the man applying pressure on an area between the scrotum and the anus, and cause a retrograde ejaculation into the bladder. Needham called this method ""coitus interruptus.""

===Jing (Sexual Energy)===
Another important concept of 'The Joining of the Essences' was that the union of a man and a woman would result in the creation of [[Jing (TCM)|jing]], a type of sexual energy. When in the act of lovamaking, jing would form, and the man could transform some of this jing into qi, and replenish his lifeforce. By having as much sex as possible, men had the opportunity to transform more and more jing, and as a result would see many health benefits.

===Yin/Yang===

The concept of [[Yin and yang|Yin/yang]] is important in Daoism, and consequently also holds special importance in sex. Yang usually referred to the male gender, whereas Yin could refer to the female gender. Man and Woman were the equivalent of heaven and earth, but became disconnected. Therefore while heaven and earth are eternal, man and woman suffer a premature death. Every interaction between Yin and Yang had significance. Because of this significance, every position and action in lovemaking had importance. This resulted in a huge amount of special sexual positions being described in Daoist texts that serve to cure or prevent illness.

==The Position of Women==

For Daoists, sex was not just about pleasing the man, but the woman also had to be pleased in order to benefit from the act of sex. Sex could only happen if both partners desired it. If sex was performed in this manner, the woman would create more jing, and the man could more easily absorb it to increase his own qi. Women were also given a prominent place in the Ishimpo, with the tutor being a woman. One of the reasons women had a great deal of strength in the act of sex was that they walked away undiminished from the act. The woman had the power to bring forth life, and did not have to worry about ejaculation. 

Yet, women were still given a position of inferiority in sexual practice. Men were encouraged to not limit themselves to one woman, and were advised only have sex with a woman who was beautiful and had not had children. While the man had to please the woman sexually, she was still just an object. At numerous points during the Ishimpo, the woman is referred to as the ‘enemy.’ This was because part of the act of intercourse was to assume dominance of the woman’s sexual prowess. He did this by retaining the semen. Each time he successfully practice this, he affirmed his strength over the woman. In later sexual texts from the Ming, women had lost all semblance of being human and were referred to as the ‘other, ‘crucible’ or ‘stove.’ The importance of pleasing the woman also diminished in later texts. 

Women were also considered to be a means for men to extend their lives. Many of the ancient texts were dedicated to how a man could use sex to extend his own life. But, his life was only extended through the absorption of the woman’s vital energies (jing and qi). Daoists called the act of sex “The battle of stealing and strengthening.”<ref>Wile (1992), p. 11.</ref> These sexual methods could be correlated with Daoist military methods. Instead of storming the gates, the battle was a series of feints and maneuvers that would sap the enemy’s resistance.

==When and Where to have Sex==

The Ishimpo is very clear that certain times were better for intercourse than others. A person had to avoid having intercourse on quarter or full moons and days when there were great winds, rain, fog, cold or heat, thunder, lightning, darkness over heaven and earth, solar and lunar eclipses, rainbows and earthquakes. Having intercourse at these times would harm a man’s spirit and causes women to become ill. Children conceived at these times will be mad, stupid, perverse or foolish; mute, deaf, crippled or blind; unfilial and violent. 

Also important was selecting the right day for intercourse if a person desired children. After the woman’s period, the first, third or fifth days were the best. If on these days the man ejaculated after midnight, the child would likely be male. If a female child is desired, the man sneeded to ejaculate on the second, fourth or sixth days after the cessation of the woman's period.

The location of sex was also important. People had to avoid the glare of the sun, moon or stars, the interior of shrines, proximity to Buddhist temples, wells, stoves and privies, and the vicinity to graves or coffins.

If these suggestions were followed the family's offspring would be good, wise and virtuous. If they were not followed, the offspring would be evil and stupid, and the family would eventually die off.

==Modern Practices==

While the ancient sexual arts died out, a surge of new interest in Daoist sexual practice has led modern-day practitioners to develop new exercises based on the old arts. Some of these exercises include variants on Kegel exercises, that involve the strengthening of the pelvic muscles. In addition, some modern health practitioners have advocated a modern-day version of 'coitus interruptus' that involves pressing the perineum and causing a retrograde ejaculation. Eventually through practice, men are supposedly able to avoid ajaculation all together and experience more powerful orgasms without any fluid loss or down time.

There is little evidence to support the health claims of this practice.  The debate is somewhat controversial because of the lack of proper research.  The opponents to these practices claim that they may be unhealthy (particularly the application of pressure on the perineum to prevent ejaculation) -- possibly inherently, but especially if done incorrectly.  One criticism is the occurrence of [[retrograde ejaculation]], where the ejaculatory fluids actually end up in the [[urinary bladder]], to be [[urine|urinated]] out shortly after the [[erection]] subsides.  Although the health risks associated with retrograde ejaculation are rare, it is improper practice if nothing else and can be easily avoided.  Another claim against the practice of withholding ejaculation is that the pressure from the force of ejaculation (the contractions of the [[prostate]] gland), can actually cause damage to the [[urethra]], [[vas deferens]], or other parts of the [[reproductive system]] by sudden force against the valves designed to be one way.  Both of these claims have little research to back them, as do the claims of the modern-day Daoists.  The modern-day Daoists use experience as the grounds of their research, with their practices evolving over generations of practioners.  Western culture in general overlooks subjective data because it is not repeatable or controllable. More controlled studies may be needed on the subject to support or provide evidence for or against the health claims about this practice.

'''Margarete Steiff''' (July 24, 1847 - May 9, 1909),  was a [[Sewing|seamstress]] who in 1880 founded [[Margarete Steiff GmbH]], making [[toy]] [[stuffed animal]]s.

Born in [[Giengen]], [[Germany]] she used a [[wheelchair]], due to [[polio]] she contracted as a baby. She started making stuffed animals as a hobby.

These toys began as elephants, which were originally a design Steiff found in a magazine and originally sold as [[pincushion]]s to her friends. However, children began playing with them, and in the years following she went on to design many other successful animal-themed toys for children, such as [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s and [[pig]]s. She designed and made most of the [[prototype]]s herself.

She died of [[pneumonia]] in Giengen.

20,start,Adikavi Pampa,jainism,"'''Pampa''' ([[Kannada]]: ಪಂಪ) born in [[902]] C.E., also known as Adikavi Pampa, is one of the greatest [[Kannada literature|Kannada]] poets of all time. He was born in Vemulavada, [[Andhra Pradesh]] and was the court poet of King Arikesari, a [[Rashtrakuta]] feudatory. 

==Early life==
Born to a [[Jainism|Jaina]] family of [[Brahmin]] ancestry, he grew up mastering the [[Sanskrit]] and [[Prakrit]] classics as well as Jain Philosophy. Known from an early age as being deeply interested in various subjects like music, philosophy, economics and sculpture, he soon gained mastery over many of these subjects. Sensitive, modest and imaginative, Pampa has earned a veritable place in the world of [[Kannada]] literature, which has remained unquestioned even today.

==Poetic life==
A well travelled man, he settled down as the court poet of King Arekesari II, a [[Chalukya]] king and a [[Rashtrakuta]] feudatory. At the age of 39 he wrote his first masterpiece, ''Adipurana'' in [[941]] and a little later he completed ''Vikramarjuna Vijaya'' popularly known as ''Pampa Bharata''. These two works have remained unparalleled works of classic Kannada composition.

==Adipurana==
Adipurana written in Champu style, a mixed form of prose and verse is a Kannada version of the Sanskrit work by Jinasena and details the life of Adinatha (''Vrishabhadeva'') in sixteen cantos, the first Jain [[Tirthankar]]. The work focusses in his own unique style the piligrimage of a soul to perfection and attainment of ''mukti''. In the work, Pampa describes the struggle for power and control over the entire world of two brothers Bharata and Bahubali, sons of Vrishabhadeva. While Bahubali wins, he renounces the wordly pursuits in favour of his brother.
Many Jaina ''puranas'' of middle ages found a role model in this work.

==Vikramarjuna Vijaya==
'''Vikramarjuna Vijaya''', also known as '''Pampa Bharata''', is a Kannada version of the [[Mahabharata]] which was originally written by [[Vyasa]]. While Vyasa's work does not focus on any one particular hero of the epic, various sections of the epic tend to eulogise various characters. However, Pampa choose to make in his work king Arikesari a hero. He personified the king and centred his work around the [[Pandava]], [[Arjuna]]. So much is his focus on Arjuna that through out the epic, Arjuna remains the hero. Even after the war of [[Kurukshetra]], it is not [[Dharmaraya]] who is crowned king but Arjuna and his wife [[Subhadra]] becomes the queen royal. It is said that [[Bhima]] who played such a big role in Vyasa's epic and Draupadi who suffered much humiliation are not given much credit in Pampa's work.

The '''Walden – Wallkill Rail Trail''', also known as the '''Jesse McHugh Rail Trail''', is a {{convert|3.22|mi|km|adj=on}} [[rail trail]] between the [[Walden, New York|village of Walden]] in the [[Montgomery (town), New York|town of Montgomery]] and the [[Wallkill, Ulster County, New York|hamlet of Wallkill]] in the [[Shawangunk, New York|town of Shawangunk]]. Montgomery and Shawangunk are located in [[Orange County, New York|Orange]] and [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster]] counties, respectively, in [[upstate New York|upstate]] [[New York]].

The trail is part of the former [[Wallkill Valley Railroad]]'s rail [[Transport corridor|corridor]]. The land was purchased by the towns of Montgomery and Shawangunk in 1985 and converted to a public trail. The portion of the trail in Shawangunk was formally opened in 1993 and named after former [[town supervisor]] Jesse McHugh. Plans to pave the trail between Walden and Wallkill were discussed since 2001, and the route was finally paved between 2008 and 2009. The trail also includes an unofficial, unimproved section to the north of Wallkill, and intersects with both [[New York State Route 52|NY 52]] and [[New York State Route 208|NY 208]].

==History==
[[Image:WVRR 1899.jpg|thumb|left|The original Wallkill Valley rail line, stretching from Montgomery to Kingston]]
Stretching {{convert|33|mi|km}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Mabee|1995|p=40}}</ref> from [[Montgomery (town), New York|Montgomery]] to [[Kingston, New York|Kingston]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Mabee|1995|pp=50–51}}</ref> the [[Wallkill Valley Railroad]] operated from 1866<ref>{{Harvnb|Mabee|1995|p=10}}</ref> until its last regular freight run on December 31, 1977.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mabee|1995|p=135}}</ref> In the 1980s, [[Consolidated Rail Corporation|Conrail]], then the owner of the Wallkill Valley line, attempted to sell the former rail [[Transport corridor|corridor]]. The towns of Montgomery and [[Shawangunk, New York|Shawangunk]] – in [[Orange County, New York|Orange]] and [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster]] counties, respectively<ref name=""perls-343"" /> – purchased their sections of the rail line to allow ""development of a commercial corridor [as well as] utility [[easement]]s and access"" to a local [[reservoir]].<ref name=""official-montgomery"" />

The Montgomery section consisted of {{convert|2|mi|km}} from the [[Walden, New York|village of Walden]] to the town line with Shawangunk, and the Shawangunk section ran {{convert|2.3|mi|km}} north from the town line to Birch Road. The purchases were completed in August and October 1985, respectively.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mabee|1995|p=142}}</ref> In November of that year, the [[New York State Department of Correctional Services]] bought {{convert|1.4|mi|km}} of the former corridor in Shawangunk's [[Wallkill, Ulster County, New York|hamlet of Wallkill]], near the [[Wallkill Correctional Facility]]. This portion extends from Birch Road to the town line with [[Gardiner, New York|Gardiner]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Mabee|1995|pp=140, 142}}</ref> The [[Shawangunk Correctional Facility]] was built at that location.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090601/COMM/906010315/-1/NEWS |title=Wallkill Rail Trail could double in size |first=Adam |last=Bosch |date=2009-06-01 |newspaper=[[Times Herald-Record]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones Local Media Group]] |location=Middletown, NY |accessdate=2010-11-01}}</ref> South of Walden, the corridor remains an active rail line operated by the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]].<ref name=""official-montgomery"" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nysdot.gov/divisions/operating/opdm/passenger-rail/passenger-rail-repository/2010%20NYS%20Rail%20Map.pdf |title=Railroads in New York State – 2010 |date=2010-02-05 |accessdate=2010-12-28 |publisher=[[New York State Department of Transportation]] |format=PDF}}</ref>

22,stub,Agis I,biography,"'''Agis I''' was a son of [[Eurysthenes]], founder of the [[Kings of Sparta|Agiad dynasty]] ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], III, 2.1). His genealogy was traced through [[Aristodemus]], Aristomachus, Cleodaeus and Hyllus to [[Heracles]] ([[Herodotus]] 7, 204), and he belongs rather to mythology than to history.  Tradition ascribed to him the capture of the maritime town of Helos, which resisted his attempt to curtail its guaranteed rights, and the institution of the class of serfs called [[Helots]].

The '''glucocorticoid receptor''' ('''GR''') also known as '''NR3C1''' ([[nuclear receptor]] subfamily 3, group C, member 1) is a  [[ligand]]-activated [[transcription factor]]  that binds with high [[affinity]] to [[cortisol]] and other [[glucocorticoids]].<ref name=""Lu"">{{cite journal |author=Lu NZ, Wardell SE, Burnstein KL, Defranco D, Fuller PJ, Giguere V, Hochberg RB, McKay L, Renoir JM, Weigel NL, Wilson EM, McDonnell DP, Cidlowski JA |title=International Union of Pharmacology.

The GR is expressed in almost every cell in the body and regulates either directly or indirectly genes controlling a wide variety of processes including the [[Developmental biology|development]], [[metabolism]], and [[Immune system|immune response]] of the organism.

The GR protein is encoded by [[gene]] {{Gene|NR3C1}} on [[chromosome 5 (human)|chromosome 5]] (5q31).

* '''D''' - hinge region
* '''E''' - ligand-binding domain (LBD)
* '''F''' - [[C-terminus|C-terminal]] domain

==Ligand binding and response==
In the absence of hormone, the  glucocorticoid receptor (GR) resides in the cytosol complexed with a variety of proteins including heat shock protein 90 ([[hsp90]]), the heat shock protein 70 ([[hsp70]]) and the protein [[FKBP52]] (FK506-binding protein 52).<ref name=""Pratt"">{{cite journal |author=Pratt WB, Morishima Y, Murphy M, Harrell M |title=Chaperoning of glucocorticoid receptors |journal=Handb Exp Pharmacol |volume=172 |issue= |pages=111-38 |year=2006 |pmid= 16610357}}</ref>  The endogenous glucocortiod hormone [[cortisol]] diffuses through the cell membrane into the cytoplasm and binds to the  glucocorticoid receptor (GR) resulting in release of the heat shock proteins.  The resulting activated form GR has two principle mechanisms of action:<ref name=""Buckingham"">{{cite journal |author=Buckingham JC |title=Glucocorticoids: exemplars of multi-tasking |journal= Br J Pharmacol |volume= 147 |issue=Supplement 1 |pages=S258-68 |year=2006 |pmid= 16402112 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bjp.0706456}}</ref><ref name=""Hayashi"">{{cite journal |author=Hayashi R, Wada H, Ito K, Adcock IM |title=Effects of glucocorticoids on gene transcription |journal= Eur J Pharmacol |volume= 500 |issue=1-3 |pages=51-62 |year= 2004 |pmid= 15464020 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2004.07.011}}</ref>

===Transactivation===
A direct mechanism of action involves [[homodimerization]] of the receptor, translocation via active transport into the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], and binding to specific [[DNA responsive element]]s activating gene [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. This mechanism of action is referred to as [[transactivation]].  The biologic response depends on the cell type.

===Transrepression===
In the absence of activated GR, other transcription factors such as [[NF-kB|NF-κB]] or [[AP-1 (transcription factor)|AP-1]] themselves are able to transactivate target genes.  However activated GR can complex with these other transcription factors and prevent them from binding their target genes and hence repress the expression of genes that are normally upregulated by NF-κB or AP-1. This indirect mechanism of action is referred to as [[transrepression]].

==Agonists and antagonists==
[[Dexamethasone]] is an agonist, and [[RU486]] and [[cyproterone]] are antagonists of the GR. Also, [[progesterone]] and [[DHEA]] have antagonist effects on the GR.

The GR is abnormal in [[familial glucocorticoid resistance]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mendonca B, Leite M, de Castro M, Kino T, Elias L, Bachega T, Arnhold I, Chrousos G, Latronico A |title=Female pseudohermaphroditism caused by a novel homozygous missense mutation of the GR gene |journal=J Clin Endocrinol Metab |volume=87 |issue=4 |pages=1805-9 | doi = 10.1210/jc.87.4.1805 |year=2002 |pmid=11932321}}</ref>

'''Martha Christina Tiahahu''' (4 January 1800&nbsp;– 2 January 1818) was a [[Maluku|Moluccan]] freedom fighter and [[List of National Heroes of Indonesia|National Heroine of Indonesia]].

Born to a military captain, Tiahahu was active in military matters from a young age. She joined the war led by [[Pattimura]] against the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial government]] when she was 17, fighting in several battles. After being captured in October 1817, she was released on account of her age. She continued to fight, and was captured again. Sent to [[Java]] to be a slave labourer, she fell ill on the way and, refusing to eat or take medicine, died over the [[Banda Sea]].

Tiahahu is considered a National Heroine of Indonesia, with the date of her death celebrated as a holiday. She has also been honoured with two statues, one in [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]] and one in Abubu; other namesakes include a warship, street, Moluccan social organization, and women's magazine.

==Biography==
Tiahahu was born in Abubu village on Nusalaut Island, near Maluku, on 4 January 1800.{{sfn|Azizah|2011|p=121}} Her father was Captain Paulus Tiahahu of the Soa Uluputi clan.{{sfn|Azizah|2011|p=121}}{{sfn|Alaidrus 2010, Martha Christina Si Pemberani}} After her mother died while she was an infant, Tiahahu was raised by her father.{{sfn|Alaidrus 2010, Martha Christina Si Pemberani}} As a child, she was stubborn and followed her father wherever he went, at times joining him in planning attacks.{{sfn|Alaidrus 2010, Martha Christina Si Pemberani}}

Beginning in 1817 Tiahahu joined her father in a guerrilla war against the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial government]].{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}} They also backed [[Pattimura]]'s army.{{sfn|Azizah|2011|p=121}} She saw several battles. In a battle at [[Saparua|Saparua Island]], the troops killed Dutch commander Richement and wounded his replacement Commander Meyer.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}} In another battle, she and her troops succeeded in burning Duurstede Fortress to the ground.{{sfn|Alaidrus 2010, Martha Christina Si Pemberani}} During battles, she was said to throw stones at the Dutch troops if her soldiers were out of ammunition, while other accounts have her wielding a spear.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}}{{sfn|Alaidrus 2010, Martha Christina Si Pemberani}} After Vermeulen Kringer took over the Dutch military in Maluku, Tiahahu, her father, and Pattimura were captured in October 1817.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}}

Carried on the HNLMS ''Evertsen'' to Nusalaut, Tiahahu was the only captured soldier not punished; this was due to her young age.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}} After a period of time in holding in Fort Beverwijk, where her father was executed, in late 1817 Tiahahu was released.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}} She continued to fight against the Dutch.{{sfn|Alaidrus 2010, Martha Christina Si Pemberani}}

In a sweep in December 1817 Tiahahu and several other former rebels were caught.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}} The captured guerrillas were placed on the ''Evertsen'' to be transported to [[Java]]; they were meant to be used as slave labour on the coffee plantations there.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}} However, on the way Tiahahu fell ill.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}} Refusing medication and food, she died on 2 January 1818 while the ship was over the [[Banda Sea]]; she received a [[burial at sea]] later that day.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}}{{sfn|Alaidrus 2010, Martha Christina Si Pemberani}}

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Standbeeld van vrijheidsstrijdster Martha Christina Tiahahu (1800-1818) TMnr 20017956.jpg|thumb|The statue to Tiahahu in Ambon]]
Soon after [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesia's independence]], Tiahahu was declared a [[List of National Heroes of Indonesia|National Heroine of Indonesia]];{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}} 2 January was designated Martha Christina Tiahahu Day.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}} On that day, people in Maluku spread flower petals over the Banda Sea in an official ceremony honouring her struggle.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}} However, the ceremony is smaller than that honouring Pattimura, on 15 May.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}}

Several monuments have been dedicated to Tiahahu. In [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]], capital of the [[Maluku (province)|province of Maluku]], an {{convert|8|m|ft|adj=on}} tall statue of her holding a spear was erected in 1977; it stands in Karangpanjang overlooking the Banda Sea.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}} In Abubu, a statue of her leading soldiers while holding a spear was erected and dedicated on the 190th anniversary of her death.{{sfn|Alaidrus 2010, Martha Christina Si Pemberani}}{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}} She also has several items named after her, including a street in Karangpanjang, Ambon, and a warship, the KRI ''Martha Christina Tiahahu''.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}}

Other organizations have also taken Tiahahu's name as a symbol of bravery and ""spirit of struggle"", including a social organization for Moluccans in [[Jakarta]] and a women's magazine in Ambon.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}}

'''St Peter's Church''' is the former [[parish church]] of [[Barton-upon-Humber]] in [[North Lincolnshire]], [[England]].  It is one of the best known [[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Anglo-Saxon buildings]], in part due to its role in [[Thomas Rickman]]'s identification of the style.  It has been subject to major excavations, which are the most comprehensive for any parish church in Britain.  It is now run by [[English Heritage]] and houses an exhibition exploring its history.

==Origins==
The church lies immediately east of the remains of a near circular enclosure which contained a hall.  This is, on average, 820 feet in diameter and was originally surrounded by a ditch and timber [[palisade]] known to date to before 900.  An early pagan Saxon cemetery, believed to be linked with this enclosure and dated to the first half of the seventh century, was discovered at Castledyke, south of the church, and was used to bury high-status individuals.  In 669, [[Saint Chad]] founded a monastery in neighbouring [[Barrow-upon-Humber]].  An [[Anglo-Saxon charter]] dated 971 suggests that Barton became a [[grange]] attached to this monastery.<ref>Barrie Cox, ""The pattern of Old English ''burh'' in early Lindsey"", in ''Anglo-Saxon England: 23'', p.44</ref><ref name=""williams"">Ann Williams, ""A bell-house and a burgh-geat"", in Robert Liddiard, ''Anglo-Norman Castles'', pp.34-36</ref>

The earliest graves on the site of the church date from the ninth century, around one hundred years after the southerly cemetery was abandoned.  At this stage, it appears to have been reserved for burials associated with the hall and there may have been an associated chapel, although no trace of this remains.  This was Barton's first [[Christian]] cemetery.<ref name=""drinkall"">Gail Drinkall and Martin Foreman, ''The Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Castledyke South, Barton-on-Humber'', pp.16, 24, 363-364</ref>

The dating of the church is somewhat controversial.  [[English Heritage]] date the [[baptistery]] to the ninth century and the tower [[nave]] to the tenth century.<ref name=""images"">[http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=165516&mode=adv Details for IoE Number: 165516], Images of England</ref>  Some other sources give a slightly later date, between 970 and 1030.<ref name=""williams"" />  In particular, it is uncertain whether the baptistery does predate the tower or if the two are contemporary.<ref name=""jenkins"">[[Simon Jenkins]], ''England's Thousand Best Churches'', p.367</ref>  Around the date of construction the ditch to the east was infilled, allowing level access between the hall and the church.<ref name=""williams"" />  Unusually, graves disturbed by the laying of foundations were carefully relocated.<ref name=""hadley"">Dawn M. Hadley and Jo Buckbery, ''Pastoral care in late Anglo-Saxon England'', in Francesca Tinti, ''Pastoral care in late Anglo-Saxon England'', p.132-134</ref>

==Architecture==
The church was originally [[Anglo-Saxon turriform churches|turriform]]: the ground floor of the tower served as the nave.<ref>Ernest Arthur Fisher, ''An Introduction to Anglo-Saxon Architecture and Sculpture'', London: Faber, 1959, OCLC 1279628, p. 57.</ref>

The tower shows typical features of [[Saxon]] architecture: walls of rendered [[rubble]], with decorative [[pilaster]] strip work, and long and short work.<ref name=""images"" /><ref name=""oxford"">Timothy Darvill et al, ''England: an Oxford archaeological guide to sites from earliest times to AD 1600'', p.135</ref>  The pilasters do not provide any possible support—some are only very shallowly set into the wall.  They are cut from Roman [[ashlar]]s.<ref name=""rodwell"">[[Warwick Rodwell]], ""Anglo Saxon Church Building: Aspects of Design and Construction"", in ''The Archaeology of Anglo-Saxon England: Basic Readings'', pp.196-225</ref>  Oak beams survive at two levels in the tower; these would originally have supported higher floors.  The first floor must have been a gallery, as there are no windows at ground floor level.<ref name=""rodwell"" />  The tower has only a few, small, windows, with either round or triangular [[windowhead|head]]s, and they are divided by a shaft.<ref name=""jenkins"" />  There are north and south doorways, which appear to have originally possessed timber [[porch]]es.  The roof would have been of timber construction, probably of stepped pyramidal form, and covered with [[shingle]]s.<ref name=""rodwell"" />

The tower is linked to the baptistery by a narrow doorway, which originally had a timber doorcase.  Excavations have revealed a [[font]] base buried in the floor of the room.<ref name=""rodwell"" />  Externally, it is plainer than the tower, with even fewer, simple windows.<ref name=""oxford"" />  On the opposite side of the tower to the baptistery, a [[chancel]] was constructed.<ref name=""images"" />  Foundations of a permanent [[altar]] and a screen have been found under this space.<ref name=""rodwell"" />  Both baptistery and chancel would have had flat ceilings with [[attic]]s above.<ref name=""rodwell"" />

[[File:St Peters Barton-upon-Humber3.jpg|thumb|right|The mediaeval nave]]
Barton thrived as a town, and was recorded in the [[Domesday Book]] housing two mills and a ferry, worth £4 per year.<ref name=""williams"" />  In the early [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] period, perhaps the late eleventh century, a third storey was added to the tower of St Peter's, using dressed [[limestone]]<ref name=""oxford"" /> in a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style.

The chancel of St Peter's was demolished in the fourteenth century to make way for a much larger church, to the east of the existing tower.<ref name=""jenkins"" />  The earliest parts of this extension are in the [[Decorated Gothic]] style, with some of the arcade [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]s reused from the earlier building.  One of these depicts a [[Green Man]].<ref name=""jenkins"" />   The east window retains contemporary [[stained glass]] depicting [[Saint George]] and [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]], while the [[clerestory]] dates from around 1430, as does a [[rood]] window at the east end of the north [[aisle]].  Other historic monuments include the fifteenth century chancel effigy and rood screen, and wall monuments from the late sixteenth century.<ref name=""images"" />

In about 1310, a [[cross]] was constructed in the churchyard.  This is [[Grade II listed]] in its own right,<ref>[http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=165517&mode=adv Details for IoE Number: 165517], Images of England</ref> as is part of the churchyard wall.<ref>[http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=165518&mode=adv Details for IoE Number: 165518], Images of England</ref>

==Early investigations==
[[Thomas Rickman]], a keen [[architectural historian]] and author of ''An Attempt to Discriminate the Styles of English Architecture'',<ref>""[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23607?docPos=2 Rickman, Thomas]"", ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''</ref> investigated the church in 1819.<ref name=""rodwell"" />  His inspection led him to describe the principle of ""structural stratification""—where one phase of building rests on another, the second must be of an earlier date.  This enabled him, for the first time, to persuasively argue that a standing structure must be of Anglo-Saxon date, as the Norman top storey of the tower was supported by two stories constructed in a very different, then unknown, style.<ref>''Current archaeology, Issues 76-89'', p.209</ref>  Previously, while some work had been labelled as Saxon, this was all [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], and only guesswork attempted to distinguish this from [[Norman architecture]].  Rickman presented his influential hypothesis that St Peter's and [[St Thomas of Canterbury Church, Clapham]] possessed Saxon towers in an updated edition of ''An Attempt to Discriminate...''.<ref>[[Thomas Rickman]], ''An attempt to discriminate the styles of architecture in England'' (5th Edition), pp.55-56</ref>

==Excavation and restoration==
[[File:St Peter's Church, Barton-upon-Humber, SW view.jpg|thumb|right|View from the south east, showing the nave, south aisle, porch and tower]]
The church has been Grade A listed in 1965, a status since converted to [[Grade I listed|Grade I]].<ref name=""images"" />  It was closed in 1970, its former [[chapel-of-ease]], [[St Mary's Church, Barton-on-Humber|St Mary's]], becoming the parish church.  Ownership was taken over by the [[Department of the Environment]].<ref name=""project"">[http://www.stpetersbarton.org.uk/index.html St Peter's Church Project Barton-upon-Humber]</ref>

[[Harold McCarter Taylor]] identified the church as an ideal location for an archaeological excavation, given that it was, uniquely, a substantial Saxon church which was no longer used for worship.  He noted that, as the building had been examined repeatedly by architectural historians, there was little possibility of resolving the considerable questions about its construction and history without excavations.  In 1977, he secured funding from the Department of the Environment, and began the most extensive archaeological investigation ever undertaken of a British parish church,<ref name=""rodwell"" /> not completed until 1985.<ref name=""project"" />  3,000 skeletons were removed from the site, providing what has been described as ""an [[osteological]] record unparalleled for any small town in England"".<ref name=""drinkall"" />  Due to waterlogged conditions, in some cases, wooden coffins had also survived.  Some of these were dug-out logs, while some are believed to be constructed from old boats.  At least ten burials were accompanied by [[hazel]] rods, and one had a pillow of organic material.<ref name=""hadley"" />

Alongside the excavation, extensive repairs to the building were undertaken.<ref name=""project"" />  In 2007, the skeletons were placed in an on-site [[ossuary]], so as to leave them in consecrated ground close to their original location, while still permitting future study.<ref>[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk//publications/conservation-bulletin-58/ Conservation Buletin 58], [[English Heritage]]</ref>  Three skeletons remain on display in the church, alongside a selection of [[grave goods]] and two coffins.  The church was opened by English Heritage as a visitor attraction in May 2007.<ref>[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.10974 Anglo Saxon church reveals its secrets], [[English Heritage]] {{deadlink|date=January 2011}}</ref>

26,b,Line 4 Sheppard,trainswikiproject,"{{Toronto_Subway_Lines}}
The '''Sheppard Line''' is the newest [[Toronto subway and RT|subway line]] line in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], operated by the [[Toronto Transit Commission]]. It currently has five [[metro station|stations]] and is 5.5 [[kilometre]]s (3.4 [[mile]]s) long. It opened on [[November 24]], [[2002 in Canada|2002]]. It is internally numbered as Route 4, but this number is not shown on TTC maps, signs, or schedules and is rarely used or even known by the public.

The '''385 Sheppard East''' bus provides late night service when the subway is not in operation. This service terminates at Sheppard-Yonge Station and follows Sheppard Avenue to Meadowvale.  Bus service is extended on Sundays because the subway and RT starts at 9:00 am instead the usual 6:00 am start.

==History==
Plans were developed in the early 1990s to build new subway lines along [[Eglinton Avenue|Eglinton]] and [[Sheppard Avenue|Sheppard]] Avenues. With the election of the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative]] provincial government in [[1995 in Canada|1995]], work on the Eglinton line was halted, but the Sheppard line was constructed. Some believed that North York Mayor [[Mel Lastman]]'s political clout (he was later elected Mayor of the amalgamated City of Toronto) was enough to ensure that his Sheppard line ""pet project"" was built. The [[Downsview (TTC)|Downsview station]] was added to the [[Yonge-University-Spadina (TTC)|Spadina line]] partially in anticipation of the Sheppard project westward extension. 

The Sheppard subway is unusual in that it was the first ""suburban"" subway; the previous TTC lines had started from downtown Toronto. However, North York, especially around Yonge and Sheppard, has seen intense high-rise developments in recent years, giving it the nickname of the ""new downtown"" that other surrounding suburban areas were increasingly relying upon. The case for building the subway line was because the existing TTC bus service could not handle the commuter capacity; full buses were passing crowds at bus stops. Although some suggested that expanding Sheppard Avenue to allow for dedicated bus lanes would have been far cheaper than a subway, there would have been political opposition from the [[Willowdale, Ontario|Willowdale community]]. The new [[Fairview Mall]] commuter parking garages at [[Don Mills (TTC)|Don Mills]] were also intended to take the pressure off of the crowded [[Finch (TTC)|Finch station]].

Another reason was to alleviate the congested [[Ontario provincial highway 404|Highway 404]]-[[Don Valley Parkway]] route; while Highway 404 was widened by the province in 1999-2001, similar plans to expand the DVP were not approved by city council, and this would result in an inevitable bottleneck. The intention was that downtown-bound drivers would exit Highway 404 at Sheppard Avenue, and take the subway to avoid this choke point.  

When the Sheppard line opened in 2002, it was the city's first new subway line in decades. It is shorter than originally planned, running from [[Yonge Street]] (at the former Sheppard station, now renamed [[Sheppard-Yonge (TTC)|Sheppard-Yonge]]) east to [[Don Mills Road]] rather than further west to [[Downsview (TTC)|Downsview station]] and southeast to [[Scarborough Centre (TTC)|Scarborough Centre station]], and will only be extended with substantial government funding.

It cost just under [[Canadian dollar|$]]1 billion and took eight years to build. It is the first subway line in Canada to be built entirely with a [[tunnel-boring machine]] (though its stations are all in cut-and-cover sections, and there is an enclosed bridge over the [[Don River (Toronto)|Don River]] near [[Leslie (TTC)|Leslie station]]). Yonge Street had to be diverted for several years in order to accommodate the expansion of the Sheppard Station.

One of the ideas proposed for the Sheppard line were [[platform screen doors]] at the edge of the platforms, that would align themselves with the subway car doors when in station for safety and [[suicide]] prevention, but the system was dropped on the account of the costs.  The stations are built to eventually take the TTC's standard subway trains of six 23 m (75-foot) cars, but part of each platform has been blocked off since only four-car trains are needed to carry the amount of traffic the line currently receives. The line is designed so that it can be extended at both ends, allowing for the construction of the originally-planned westward and eastward branches in the future. The TTC still hopes to extend the line to Scarborough Town Centre, but the westward extension is no longer a priority.

==Criticisms==
The line has been derided by critics as a 'subway to nowhere' or a 'stubway'. Apart from the Sheppard-Yonge and Don Mills terminals, its stations have received little use, even during [[rush hour]]. Service is also considered infrequent with the common 5 minute delay for trains in rush hour versus the 2-3 minute intervals for the other lines. One problem is that the subway is parallel to [[Ontario provincial highway 401|Highway 401]]; while the latter is busy, it has an efficient twelve-lane collector-express system to manage high traffic volumes.

The suburban subway is also criticised because most of the surrounded population is more affluent and more likely to drive. The Don Mills station at Fairview Mall has also sparked further controversy because the commuter lot requires a fee even if one holds a Metropass; although the parking charge was required in order to prevent the limited garage space from being overwhelmed (the regular mall parking is cordoned off until the shopping centre opens). Although the subway was intended to divert some Highway 404 southbound and 401 westbound traffic from using the congested [[Don Valley Parkway]], this plan has also not worked out to expectations due to the aforementioned parking fee and infrequent service.

The new subway, however, spurred over $1 billion of construction of new housing, including several high-rise condominum towers, along its route (particularly around [[Bayview (TTC)|Bayview station]]), with more expected in coming years.

==Stations==
[[Image:Sheppard Line.png|right|Sheppard Line thematic map]]
The entire line runs under or near Sheppard Avenue East. All of its stations, whether by transfer or in the fare-paid area, connect to surface TTC bus routes. All stations have [[elevator]]s for [[wheelchair]] [[accessibility|access]] and [[public art]]; noteworthy examples are the scenic mural at Sheppard-Yonge, the children's logo at Bayview, and the signature tiles (""Leslie-Sheppard"") at Leslie.

The TTC considers the ''Sheppard East'' extension of the Sheppard subway to [[Scarborough Centre (TTC)|Scarborough Centre]] as one of their two top priorities for rapid-transit expansion, along with a northerly extension of the [[Yonge-University-Spadina (TTC)|Spadina line]]. In addition to this eastern extension, the original plans for the Sheppard line included a westward extension to [[Downsview (TTC)|Downsview station]] on the Spadina line, but this is no longer considered a priority.

The following stations were included on the original plans, and remain likely candidates should funding to extend the line be made available:

'''Duke or Duchess of Acerenza''' is a noble title created by the Kings of Spain for Don Galeazzo Pinelli, Patrician of [[Genoa]], on 12 April [[1593]], with succession stipulated according to Spanish nobiliary law.

Don Galeazzo's father, Don Cosimo had held the office of Grand Chancellor ([http://www.sardimpex.com/varia/Cancellieri%20del%20Regno%20di%20Sicilia.htm/ 'Gran Cancelliere']) of the Kingdom of Naples from [[1557]]-[[1562]], and the feudality of Acerenza had been acquired by the Pinelli three decades before the grant in [[1563]].  Inherited by marriage with the Pinelli, the title of Duke or Duchess of Acerenza is currently held by the [[Prince or Princess Belmonte]].  It has been used historically by the Prince or Princess's heir as a courtesy title.

==Succession==
*'''Don Galeazzo Francesco Pinelli''', 1st Duke of Acerenza, Marquess of [[Tursi]], married Donna Livia Squarciafico (died [[1602]]), daughter of Don Uberto Squarciafico of Genoa (died [[1562]]).  Donna Livia's dowry included the fief of the Contea (Earldom) of Copertino, acquired in [[1557]].  Don Uberto had also acquired the feudalities of Galatone, Lequile, Veglie and Leverano in the same year.  Don Galeazzo himself obtained the Marquesate of Tursi in [[1568]] from Don [[Giovanni Andrea Doria]], 6th Prince of Melfi.

''Note:'' Don Galeazzo was the son and heir of Don Cosimo Pinelli, (d. [[1601]]), himself son of Donna Livia Squarciafico and Don Galeazzo Pinelli.  Don Cosimo was married twice: to Donna Nicoletta Grillo, daughter of Don Agapito Grillo, Guardian ('Custode') of the Galley of Admiral [[Andrea Doria]], and of Donna Luisa, daughter of Don Marco Centurione [[Marquess of Estepa]] and of Donna Battina Negrone, and previously to Donna Dianora d’Avalos.  (Donna Clemenza and Donna Lucrezia were the daughters of Don Cosimo by Donna Dianora.  The former married Don Fabrizio [http://www.sardimpex.com/files/CANTELMO.HTM Cantelmo], 4th Duke of Popoli, of the ancient Provencal seigneurs of Tarascon, Boulbon and Romans, the latter married Don Antonio [http://www.sardimpex.com/Files%204/GUEVARA.htm Guevara], of the Counts of Potenza, Hereditary Grand Seneschals of the Kingdom of Sicily and Naples.)  
 
*'''Don Cosimo Pinelli''', 2nd Duke of Acerenza.  Married Donna Anna Maria Ravaschieri Fieschi, 3rd [[Princess of Belmonte]] ''suo iure''.  (Note: on 23 May [[1642]], Don Cosimo presented to the [[Archbishop of Acerenza and Matera]], [[Simone Carafa Roccella]] ([[1638]]-[[1647]]), a building for the foundation of a seminary in Acerenza to serve the diocese.)
 
*'''Don Galeazzo Francesco Pinelli''', 3rd Duke of Acerenza, married Donna Giustiniana Pignatelli, daughter of Don Fabrizio Pignatelli, 1st Prince of Noia and 3rd Marquess of Cerchiara.

''After the death of the 3rd Duke, the Princes and Princesses of Belmonte, and of the Holy Roman Empire (see [[Prince or Princess Belmonte]]) have held the subsidiary title of Duke or Duchess of Acerenza, as Grandees of Spain on the Acerenza Fief''.  The title of Duke or Duchess of Acerenza has historically been the courtesy title of the Prince or Princess's heir of line.

*'''HE Prince Don Oronzo Ravaschieri Fieschi Pinelli''', Prince of Belmonte, 4th Duke of Acerenza

*'''HSH Princess (Fürstin) Donna Anna Francesca Ravaschieri Fieschi Pinelli''', Princess of Belmonte and of the Holy Roman Empire, 5th Duchess of Acerenza

Since then, the CDC has launched a funded study (see below) that will include further examination of fibers taken from Morgellons lesions by the CDC.

In June 2007, the CDC opened a website on ""Unexplained Dermopathy (aka 'Morgellons')"".<ref name=""Investigation""/> By November 2007, the CDC had announced an investigation process, stating that, ""The primary goals of the investigation are to better describe the clinical and epidemiologic features of this condition and to generate hypotheses about possible risk factors.""<ref name=""Investigation""/> [[Kaiser Permanente]] in Northern California was chosen to assist with investigation, which will begin when the scientific protocols and review board structure have been prepared and approved.

Following a mailing campaign coordinated by the Morgellons Research Foundation in which ""self-described sufferers clicked on the foundation Web site and sent thousands of form letters to members of Congress,""<ref name=""Schulte""/> the CDC, in conjunction with Kaiser Permanente's Northern California Division of Research, launched a study of the unexplained skin condition known as Morgellons.

I cannot characterize this as a syndrome, as disease. I can tell you it's an unexplained illness."" Clinical examinations for the study will be done in [[Oakland, California]].

On 4 November 2009, the CDC issued a preliminary report based on an external peer review of the project. The report stated that ""Data collection has been completed and analysis is ongoing.""<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/unexplaineddermopathy/docs/ud_peer_review_progress-nov_2009.pdf</ref> This report also explained that any findings would most likely be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal once data analysis is complete and results are available.

== Symptoms and diagnosis ==
Morgellons is not recognized as a unique disorder, so there is currently no list of symptoms or [[differential diagnosis]] for Morgellons that is generally accepted by the medical community. Patients usually self-diagnose based on media reports and the internet.

The 2007 ''Atlas of Human Parasitology'' covers the proposed condition in its section on ""Pseudoparasites and Artifacts"":

{{quote|Many dermatologists refute the suggestion that this is an actual disease but instead indicate that many of these patients have psychological problems or other common skin disorders.  Given the large numbers of individuals who feel that they have this affliction, it will be most helpful over the coming years to have a valid scientific assessment of Morgellons disease and its possible etiology (or etiologies).  One of the chief criticisms by many patients has been that they feel the medical community and other scientists consulted have not been open to the idea that there is possibly an as yet unidentified infectious or physiologic causation for the disease. However it is certainly true that in fact many expert parasitologists, medical entomologists and other microbiologists have in fact carefully examined fibers and other materials expressed or extracted from such patients and found that biological organisms are not present. Although an apparent association of the condition with the presence of Lyme disease has been reported (Savely et al., 2006, Am J Clin Dermatol, 7:1–6), further research will be needed to help resolve the validity of Morgellons disease.  Until then, whether Morgellons disease is another name for delusional parasitosis or a real disease entity with a biologic or physiologic basis will remain up in the air.<ref name=""Atlas"">{{cite book |last=Ash |first=L.R. |coauthors=Orihel, T.C. |year=2007 |title=Atlas of Human Parasitology |edition=5 |publisher=American Society for Clinical Pathology Press |location=Chicago, Illinois |pages=386–387 |isbn=0891891676 }}</ref>}}

In delusional parasitosis, patients hold a delusional belief that they are infested with parasites. They may experience [[formication]], a sensation similar to that of insects crawling on or under the skin.

For example, formication, the sensation that bugs are crawling under ones' skin, can be caused by allergies, [[diabetic neuropathy]], [[menopause]], [[skin cancer]], [[demodex]] mites, stimulant drug abuse or [[herpes zoster]]. Both dementia and mental retardation have been reported in association with DP.<ref name=""Slaughter"">Slaughter JR et al.

Some cases of Morgellons have been diagnosed as ""cutaneous dysaesthesia"".<ref name=""Pop""/>

=== Role of the Internet ===
Morgellons patients usually self-diagnose on the [[Internet]] and find support and confirmation in on-line communities of people with similar illness beliefs.<ref name=""AJPVR""/><ref name=""PsychosomaticsLMS"">{{cite journal|coauthors=Lustig A, Mackay S, Strauss J |title=Morgellons Disease as Internet Meme |journal=Psychosomatics |year=2009 |volume=50 |pages=90 |pmid=19213978 |url=http://psy.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/50/1/90 |doi = 10.1176/appi.psy.50.1.90|last1=Lustig|first1=A|issue=1 }}</ref><ref name=""Healy""/> In 2006, Waddell and Burke reported the influence of the Internet on their self-diagnosed Morgellons patients: ""physicians are becoming more and more challenged by the many persons who attempt self-diagnosis on-line.

The ''LA Times'', in an article on Morgellons, notes that ""(t)he recent upsurge in symptoms can be traced directly to the Internet, following the naming of the disease by Mary Leitao, a Pennsylvania mother.""<ref name=""Healy""/> Robert Bartholomew, a sociologist who has studied the Morgellons phenomenon, states that the ""World Wide Web has become the incubator for mass delusion and it (Morgellons) seems to be a socially transmitted disease over the Internet.""

The ''Dallas Observer'' writes that Morgellons may be spread via the Internet and mass media, and ""(i)f this is the case, then Morgellons is one in a long line of weird diseases that have swept through populations, only to disappear without a trace once public concern subsides.""<ref name=""DallasObserver""/> The article draws parallels to several mass media-spread mass delusions. An article in the journal ''Psychosomatics'' in 2009 similarly asserts that Morgellons is an Internet [[meme]].<ref name=""Psychosomatics"">{{cite journal|coauthors=Lustig A.

=== Known skin conditions ===
It has been hypothesized that some cases of (self-diagnosed) Morgellons disease are actually other recognized skin disorders, including allergic dermatitis, [[contact dermatitis]], and the parasite [[scabies]].<ref name=""nature""/><ref name=""JAAD""/>

=== Hypotheses about the fibers ===
Randy Wymore, a former research director of the MRF and presently director of the Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences' Center for the Investigation of Morgellons Disease, claims that Morgellons patients have masses of dark fibers visible at 60x magnification under the unbroken skin, while unaffected individuals do not.<ref name=nature/> Wymore sent samples of fibers supplied by Morgellons patients to the Police Crime Lab in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], for analysis. A forensic scientist at the Tulsa Police Crime Lab in Oklahoma searched the FBI's national database, but the Morgellons sample did not match any known fiber in the database.<ref name=""Primetime"" /> Lab director Mark Boese said the fibers were ""consistent with something that the body may be producing,"" adding, ""These fibers cannot be manmade and do not come from a plant. This could be a byproduct of a biological organism.""<ref name=""Primetime"">{{cite news |title='Morgellons' Mystery |publisher=ABC News Primetime |date=2006-08-09 |accessdate=2007-08-14 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/Story?id=2283503&page=1}}</ref>

Rhonda Casey, chief of pediatrics at Oklahoma State University Hospital and part of the MRF research team at OSU, claimed that she has examined many patients' skin via a [[dermatoscope]] and performed biopsies on both lesions and apparently healthy skin, and that ""she saw fibers embedded in both places. The white ones, she says, are hard to see. A dermatologist who either didn't look at all, or didn't use a dermatoscope, might not see them under the skin.""<ref name=""psychologytoday""/>

=== Bacterial hypothesis ===
Three members of the Morgellons Research Foundation, including Raphael Stricker, Director and former President of the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS), and Ginger Savely, also an ILADS member,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ilads.org |title=International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS) }}</ref> authored an article about Morgellons published by the ''American Journal of Clinical Dermatology'' in early 2006. The authors wrote that ""Morgellons disease may be linked to an undefined infectious process,"" and reported that many patients with Morgellons disease have positive [[Western blot]]s for ''[[Borrelia burgdorferi]]'', the causative agent of [[Lyme disease]], and treatment with anti-bacterials appropriate for Lyme disease leads to remission of Morgellons symptoms in most patients;<ref name=""AJCD""/> however, no methodology or clinical data are provided in support of any of these claims.  Harvey, another member of ILADS, has also stated there is [[serology|serological]] evidence of bacterial pathogens in Morgellons patients, but did not provide any such evidence.<ref name=""Harvey""/> Stricker, along with Citovsky, MRF board member from the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]], claimed that Morgellons skin fibers could come from ''[[Agrobacterium]]'', a plant-infecting organism known to induce cellulose fibers at infected sites within plant tissues.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Stricker |first1=R.B. |last2=Savely |first2=V.R. |last3=Zaltsman |first3=A. |last4=Citovsky |first4=V. |title=Contribution of ''Agrobacterium'' to morgellons disease |journal=J Invest Med |year=2007 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=S123 #287 Suppl.

=== Environmental toxins ===
Richard Fagerlund, an entomologist who has a column titled ""Ask the Bugman"" in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and ''[[Albuquerque Journal]]'', stated that he takes Morgellons disease seriously, and he receives letters from people with Morgellons symptoms daily. Twenty years ago, he got three to four letters like this a year. He believes the condition is reaching epidemic proportions and speculates only a small percentage of cases are delusional parasitosis, while the rest may be caused by something else, such as pollutants, especially [[pesticide]]s.<ref name=""SFchron"">{{cite news |title=Persistent scabies-like condition may not be all in people's heads |first=Richard |last=Fagerlund |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=2006-12-30 |page=F-6 |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/12/30/HOG2VN91IS1.DTL  }}</ref>

== Treatment ==
=== Treatment for delusional parasitosis ===
Many dermatologists treat Morgellons as delusional parasitosis. After a thorough medical examination to rule out known organic causes for the symptoms, delusional parasitosis patients are typically prescribed one of several [[typical antipsychotic]] drugs.<ref name=""Koo"">{{Cite journal |last1=Koo |first1=J. |last2=Lee |first2=C.S. |title=Delusions of Parasitosis: A Dermatologist's Guide to Diagnosis and Treatment |journal=Am J Clin Dermatol |year=2001 |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=285–290 |pmid=11721647 |doi=10.2165/00128071-200102050-00003 }}</ref><ref name=""Meehan"">{{Cite journal |last1=Meehan |first=W.J. |last2=Badreshia |first2=S. |last3=Mackley |first3=C.L. |title=Successful treatment of delusions of parasitosis with olanzapine |date=2006-03 |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=142 |issue=3 |pages=352–355 |pmid=16549712 |url=http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/142/3/352 |doi=10.1001/archderm.142.3.352 }}</ref> In the past, [[pimozide]] was the drug of choice; in addition to antipsychotic activity, it also has [[antipruritic]] activity, meaning it inhibits the sensation of itching.<ref name=""Koblenzer"">{{cite journal |last=Koblenzer |first=C.S. |title=Pimozide at least as safe and perhaps more effective than olanzapine for treatment of Morgellons disease |year=2006 |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=142 |issue=10 |pages=1364 |pmid=17043201 |doi=10.1001/archderm.142.10.1364-b }}</ref> However, pimozide requires frequent electrocardiographic monitoring.<ref name=""Meehan""/> Currently, [[atypical antipsychotic]]s such as [[olanzapine]] or [[risperidone]] are used as first line treatment.<ref name=""Meehan""/> Antipsychotics are effective at treating delusional parasitosis at doses as low as one-fifth to one-tenth the dose typically prescribed for schizophrenia.<ref name=""Meehan""/> It is common for patients who believe they have Morgellons to reject a physician's diagnosis of delusional parasitosis.  It has been suggested that the term Morgellons should be adopted by dermatologists to enhance their [[rapport]] with their patients, allowing them to overcome this resistance.<ref name=""Murase"">{{Cite journal |last1=Murase |first=J.E. |last2=Wu |first2=J.J. |last3=Koo |first3=J. |title=Morgellons disease: A rapport-enhancing term for delusions of parasitosis |journal=J Am Acad Dermatol |year=2006 |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=913–914 |pmid=17052509 |url=http://www.eblue.org/article/PIIS0190962206012175/fulltext |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2006.04.042 }}</ref>

A ''Popular Mechanics'' article described a dermatologist who would not allow the use of his name, citing ""concern for his safety."" He said he has ""diagnosed 50 or so Morgellons patients"" with a disorder that can result in the sensation of insects, and ""typically puts a cast over the lesions to prevent further irritation and after four weeks removes it."" According to the doctor, the patients' lesions heal under the cast.<ref name=""Pop""/>

=== Self-treatment ===
Persons with Morgellons symptoms may turn to alternative remedies described on web sites and discussion groups. Some treatments are dangerous, however, and have included the use of bleach, veterinary medicines intended for deworming horses, and industrial insecticides.<ref name=""CDC Probes""/>

==Childhood and early career==
Boyd attended Grange Primary School and it was there where his talent was first spotted when the school’s headmaster and PE coach, Mr. Cross, selected him to play for the year 6 side, despite only being 7 years old <ref name=""echoboydshottingforstars"">{{cite news

| accessdate = 2006-07-17}}</ref>. While at Grange Primary School, Boyd barely missed a game for his school. He then attended the Hartlepool Manor School of Technology and his talent was once again recognized by the school’s headmaster, Alan White, a teacher who had previously taught [[Steve Harper (footballer)|Steve Harper]] and [[Paul Kitson]]. He also played for 5 years with a [[Sunday League]] side called Hartlepool St Francis, where he started off by playing in central defence and helped the team win several trophies in the Teesside Junior Alliance league. Boyd’s talent caught the eye of Middlesbrough who sent scouts to watch him. However, they decided against signing him and he signed for Hartlepool instead, the team he and his Dad supported and regularly watched. 

==Hartlepool United==
===Hartlepool Breakthrough===
While at Hartlepool’s youth team he quickly impressed the coaching staff of Mick Smith and Billy Horner. Despite only being in the youth team a short amount of time, he was given a shock last minute call up to the first team despite being just 16. Boyd eventually made his debut against [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury]] and was immediate success after coming on a substitute and scoring a dramatic last minute goal from the tightest of angles on his debut.<ref name=""echoboyd""> {{cite news

| accessdate = 2006-07-17}}</ref> From the seasons 1999 to 2003 Boyd had started a total of 25 first team matches and made 38 substitute appearances. Despite this, Boyd had only managed to score 15 goals. 
===Under Neale Cooper and Onwards===
Boyd’s lack of first team appearances prompted the newly appointed Hartlepool manager [[Neale Cooper]] to loan him to [[Boston United F.C.| Boston United]] in order to gain match practice. During his time at Boston, Boyd won critical acclaim from Boston manager Neil Thompson and played a total of 14 matches scoring 4 goals before returning to Hartlepool<ref name="" bbcbostonboyd"">{{cite news

When asked about his weight gain, Boyd claimed that he had been eating more to build up his strength but when asked about gym work he said he had not started it yet. .<ref name=""guardianboyd"">{{cite news

It was rumoured that Hartlepool chairman, [[Ken Hodcroft]], wanted a five figure sum, which at the time seemed steep for an unproven striker and it was thought that Boston were only prepared to pay a four figure sum of around £5,000. <ref name=""echoboydshottingforstars"">{{cite news

Boyd was then a surprise inclusion in the team to face Stockport and came on as a sub after 45 minutes. The next game away at to [[Grimsby Town F.C.| Grimsby]] saw Boyd get his first start of the season for Pools and score two goals.

[[Image: Boydscores.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Adam Boyd scoring what was to be the Hartlepool United Goal of the Season 2005 against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.| Sheffield Wednesday]]]]
The following season Boyd became one of the most feared strikers in League 1 and formed a strong partnership with fellow striker [[Joel Porter]]. He scored 29 goals in league and cup and became the club’s highest goalscorer since Joe Allon in 1991. The pick of Boyd’s goals came against Sheffield Wednesday where Boyd received the ball outside the box and faked his way past two players before chipping a lovely effort over [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.| Sheffield Wednesday]] keeper Gallacher.

'''John Henry Newman''', [[D.D.]], [[Oratory of Saint Philip Neri|C.O.]] (21 February 1801&nbsp;– 11 August 1890<ref name=HRCNewman>{{cite web|last=Miranda |first=Salvador |title=John Henry Newman |url=http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1879.htm#Newman |work=The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church |accessdate=2 February 2010}}</ref><ref name=CEnc>{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=John Henry Newman}}</ref>), also referred to as '''Cardinal Newman''' and '''Blessed John Henry Newman''', was an important figure in the religious history of England in the 19th century. He was known nationally by the mid-1830s.<ref>Gilley, p. 201.</ref>

Originally an evangelical Oxford academic and priest in the [[Church of England]], Newman was a leader in the [[Oxford Movement]]. This influential grouping of [[Anglican]]s wished to return the Church of England to many Catholic beliefs and forms of worship traditional in the medieval times to restore ritual expression. In 1845 Newman left the Church of England and was received into the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] where he was eventually granted the rank of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] by [[Pope Leo XIII]]. He was instrumental in the founding of the [[Catholic University of Ireland]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Brian|title=John Henry Newman: his life and work|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2001|pages=96–112|isbn=9780826449931|url=http://books.google.ie/books?id=IZKW51HSqOUC&pg=PA102&dq=%22john+henry+newman%22+%22catholic+university+of+ireland%22&hl=en&ei=mR7BTfysNNSbhQf23sS9BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=04-05-2011}}</ref> which evolved into [[University College, Dublin]], today, the largest university in Ireland.

Newman's [[beatification]] was officially proclaimed by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] on 19 September 2010 during his [[Pope Benedict XVI's visit to the United Kingdom#cite note-18|visit]] to the United Kingdom.<ref name=Beatification/> His [[Canonization|canonisation]] is dependent on the documentation of additional miracles.

Newman was also a literary figure of note: his major writings including his autobiography ''[[Apologia Pro Vita Sua]]'' (1865–66), the ''[[Grammar of Assent]]'' (1870), and the poem ''[[The Dream of Gerontius (poem)|The Dream of Gerontius]]'' (1865), which was set to music in 1900 by [[Edward Elgar]] as [[The Dream of Gerontius|an oratorio]].<ref name=""CEnc""/> He wrote the popular hymns ""[[Lead, Kindly Light]]"" and ""Praise to the Holiest in the Height"" (taken from ''Gerontius'').

==Early life and education==
Newman was born in the [[City of London]],<ref>[http://www.newmanreader.org/biography/death/life.html ""A Short Life of Cardinal Newman""], newmanreader.org.</ref> the eldest of a family of three sons and three daughters. His father, John Newman, was a banker with Ramsbottom, Newman and Company in [[Lombard Street]]. His mother, Jemima (née Fourdrinier), was descended from French [[Huguenot]] refugees in England. [[Francis William Newman]] was a younger brother.  His eldest sister, Harriet Elizabeth, married [[Thomas Mozley]], also prominent in the Oxford Movement.<ref name = DNB>{{Cite DNB|wstitle=Newman, John Henry}}</ref>

===At school in Ealing===
At the age of seven Newman was sent to [[Great Ealing School]] conducted by George Nicholas. There George Huxley, father of [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], taught [[mathematics]],<ref>[[Cyril Bibby]]'s ''T. H. Huxley: Scientist Extraordinary''.</ref> and the classics teacher was Walter Mayers.<ref name = Gilley18>Gilley, p. 18.</ref> Newman took no part in the casual school games.<ref>Gilley, p. 11.</ref> He was a great reader of the novels of [[Walter Scott]], then in course of publication, and of [[Robert Southey]]. Aged 14, he read sceptical works by [[Thomas Paine]], [[David Hume]] and perhaps [[Voltaire]].<ref>Gilley, p. 13.</ref> [[File:Oriel College First Quad.jpg|thumb|right|330px|Oriel College, Oxford]]

===Evangelical===
At the age of 15, during his last year at school, Newman was converted, an incident of which he wrote in his ''Apologia'' that it was ""more certain than that I have hands or feet"".<ref>[http://www.newmanreader.org/works/apologia65/Chapter1.html ''Apologia'', Chapter 1]</ref> Almost at the same time (March 1816) the bank Ramsbottom, Newman and Co. crashed, though it paid its creditors and his father left to manage a [[brewery]].<ref>Gilley, pp. 13–14.</ref> Mayers, who had himself undergone a conversion in 1814, lent Newman books from the English [[Calvinist]] tradition.<ref name = Gilley18/> It was in the autumn of 1816 that Newman ""fell under the influence of a definite creed,"" and received into his intellect ""impressions of [[dogma]], which, through God's mercy, have never been effaced or obscured"".<ref>[http://www.newmanreader.org/works/apologia/part3.html ''Apologia'', part 3]</ref>  He became an evangelical Calvinist and held the typical belief that the [[Pope was Antichrist]] under the influence of the writings of [[Thomas Newton]],<ref>Gilley, p. 19.</ref> as well as his reading of [[Joseph Milner]]'s ''History of the Church of Christ''.<ref name = DNB/> Mayers is described as a moderate, [[Clapham Sect]] Calvinist,<ref>Gilley, p. 21.</ref> and Newman read [[William Law]] as well as [[William Beveridge (bishop)|William Beveridge]] in devotional literature.<ref>Gilley, p. 22.</ref> He also read ''The Force of Truth'' by [[Thomas Scott (commentator)|Thomas Scott]].<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/vnews/getstory.asp?number=109256 ""Benedict XVI's Message to Newman Conference""], ''[[Zenit News Agency|ZENIT]]'', 22 November 2010.</ref>

Although to the end of his life Newman looked back on his conversion to evangelical Christianity in 1816 as the saving of his soul, he gradually outgrew his early Calvinism. As [[Eamon Duffy]] puts it, ""He came to see [[Evangelicalism]], with its emphasis on religious feeling and on the Reformation doctrine of [[justification by faith alone]], as a Trojan horse for an undogmatic religious [[individualism]] that ignored the Church's role in the transmission of [[revealed truth]], and that must lead inexorably to [[subjectivism]] and [[skepticism]].""<ref name=Duffy>Eamon Duffy [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/dec/23/hero-church ""A Hero of the Church""]. ''New York Times Review of Books'', 23 December 2010.</ref>

===At university===
 Newman's name was entered at [[Lincoln's Inn]]. He was, however, sent shortly to [[Trinity College, Oxford]], where he studied widely. Anxiety to do well in the final schools produced the opposite result; he broke down in the examination, under [[Thomas Vowler Short]],<ref>{{Cite DNB|wstitle=Short, Thomas Vowler}}</ref> and so graduated as a BA with third-class honours in 1821.

Desiring to remain in Oxford, Newman then took private pupils and read for a fellowship at [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel]], then ""the acknowledged centre of Oxford intellectualism."" He was elected at Oriel on 12 April 1822. [[Edward Bouverie Pusey]] was elected a fellow of the same college in 1823.

==Anglican priest==
[[File:j-h-newman.jpg|thumb|right|170px|J. H. Newman age 23 when he preached his first [[sermon]].]]
On 13 June 1824, Newman was ordained as an Anglican deacon in [[Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford]]. Ten days later he preached his first sermon in Holy Trinity at Over [[Worton]], near [[Banbury]], [[Oxfordshire]] when on a visit to his former teacher, the Reverend Walter Mayers, who had been curate there since 1823.<ref>[http://www.deddington.org.uk/history/people/jhnewman J.H. Newman at Deddington]</ref> On Trinity Sunday, 29 May 1825, he was ordained a priest in Christ Church. He became, at Pusey's suggestion, curate of [[St Clement's Church, Oxford]]. Here, for two years, he was engaged in parochial work, and wrote articles on ''[[Apollonius of Tyana]]'', ''[[Cicero]]'' and ''[[Miracle]]s'' for the ''[[Encyclopaedia Metropolitana]]''.

[[Richard Whately]] and [[Edward Copleston]], Provost of Oriel, were leaders in the group of ''Oriel Noetics'', a group of independently thinking dons with a strong belief in free debate.<ref>''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Hawkins, Edward (1789–1882), college head, by E. W. Nicholson.</ref> In 1825, at Whately's request, Newman became vice-principal of [[St Alban Hall]], but he only held this post for one year. He attributed much of his ""mental improvement"" and partial conquest of his shyness at this time to Whately. He assisted Whately in his popular work ''Elements of Logic'' (1826, initially for the ''Encyclopaedia Metropolitana''), and from him he gained a definite idea of the [[Christian Church]] as institution: ""... a Divine appointment, and as a substantive body, independent of the State, and endowed with rights, prerogatives and powers of its own"".<ref name = DNB/>

He broke with Whately in 1827 on the occasion of the re-election of [[Robert Peel]] as [[Member of Parliament]] for the university: Newman opposed Peel on personal grounds. In 1826 he returned as tutor of Oriel, and the same year [[Richard Hurrell Froude]], described by Newman as ""one of the acutest, cleverest and deepest men"" he ever met, was elected fellow there. The two formed a high ideal of the tutorial office as clerical and pastoral rather than secular, which led to tensions in the college. In 1827 he was a preacher at [[Whitehall]].

==Oxford Movement==
In 1828 Newman supported and secured the election of [[Edward Hawkins]] as Provost of Oriel over [[John Keble]].  This choice, he later commented, produced the [[Oxford Movement]] with all its consequences. In the same year he was appointed vicar of [[University Church of St Mary the Virgin|St Mary's]], to which the living of [[Littlemore]] south of the city of Oxford was attached,<ref>[http://www.littlemorechurch.org/littlemore-newman.html St Mary & St Nicholas Church, Littlemore, Oxford]</ref> and Pusey was made [[Regius Professor of Hebrew]].

At this date, though Newman was still nominally associated with the Evangelicals, his views were gradually assuming a higher ecclesiastical tone. George Herring considers that the death of his sister Mary in January had a major impact on Newman. In the summer he worked to read the [[Church Fathers]] thoroughly.<ref>Herring, p. 52.</ref>

While local secretary of the [[Church Missionary Society]], Newman circulated an anonymous letter suggesting a method by which churchmen might practically oust [[Nonconformist]]s from all control of the society. This resulted in his being dismissed from the post, 8 March 1830; and three months later he withdrew from the [[Bible Society]],  completing his move away from the [[Low Church]] group. In 1831–1832 he was select preacher before the university. In 1832, his difference with Hawkins as to the ""substantially religious nature"" of a college tutorship became acute and he resigned from that post.

===Mediterranean travels===
In December 1832, Newman went with [[Hurrell Froude]], on account of the latter's health, for a tour in [[Southern Europe]]. On board the mail steamship ''Hermes'' they visited [[Gibraltar]], [[Malta]] and the [[Ionian Islands]], and subsequently [[Sicily]], [[Naples]] and [[Rome]], where Newman made the acquaintance of [[Nicholas Wiseman]]. In a letter home he described Rome as ""the most wonderful place on Earth,"" but the Roman Catholic religion as ""[[polytheism|polytheistic]], degrading and [[idolatry|idolatrous]].""

It was during the course of this tour that Newman wrote most of the short poems which a year later were printed in the ''Lyra Apostolica''. From Rome, instead of accompanying the Froudes home in April, Newman returned to Sicily alone, and fell dangerously ill with gastric or typhoid fever at [[Leonforte]]. He recovered, with the conviction that God still had work for him to do in England; he saw this as his third providential illness. In June 1833 he left [[Palermo]] for [[Marseille]] in an orange boat, which was becalmed in the [[Strait of Bonifacio]], and here he wrote the verses, ''[[Lead, Kindly Light]]'', which later became popular as a hymn.

===''Tracts for the Times''===
Newman was at home again in Oxford on 9 July 1833 and, on 14 July, Keble preached at St Mary’s an assize sermon on ""National Apostasy,"" which Newman afterwards regarded as the inauguration of the Oxford Movement. In the words of [[Richard William Church]], it was ""Keble who inspired, Froude who gave the impetus and Newman who took up the work""; but the first organisation of it was due to [[Hugh James Rose]], editor of the ''British Magazine'', who has been styled ""the [[Cambridge]] originator of the Oxford Movement."" Rose met Oxford Movement figures on a visit to Oxford looking for magazine contributors, and it was in his rectory house at [[Hadleigh, Suffolk]], that a meeting of [[High Church]] clergymen was held over 25–26 July (Newman was not present, but Hurrell Froude, [[Arthur Philip Perceval]] and [[William Palmer (theologian)|William Palmer]] had gone to visit Rose),<ref>{{Cite DNB|wstitle=Rose, Hugh James}}</ref> at which it was resolved to fight for ""the [[apostolic succession|apostolical succession]] and the integrity of the [[Book of Common Prayer|Prayer Book]].""

[[File:John Henry Newman - Project Gutenberg 13103.jpg|thumbnail|right|180px|'''John Henry Newman''']]

A few weeks later Newman started, apparently on his own initiative, the ''[[Tracts for the Times]]'', from which the movement was subsequently named ""Tractarian."" Its aim was to secure for the [[Church of England]] a definite basis of doctrine and discipline. At the time the state's financial stance towards the [[Church of Ireland]] had raised the spectres of disestablishment, or an exit of High Churchmen. The teaching of the [[Religious tracts|tracts]] was supplemented by Newman's Sunday afternoon sermons at St Mary's, the influence of which, especially over the junior members of the university, was increasingly marked during a period of eight years. In 1835 Pusey joined the movement, which, so far as concerned ritual observances, was later called ""Puseyite"".

In 1836 the Tractarians appeared as an activist group, in united opposition to the appointment of [[Renn Dickson Hampden]] as [[Regius Professor of Divinity]]. Hampden's 1832 [[Bampton Lectures]], in the preparation of which [[Joseph Blanco White]] had assisted him, were suspected of [[heresy]]; and this suspicion was accentuated by a pamphlet put forth by Newman, ''Elucidations of Dr Hampden's Theological Statements''.

At this date Newman became editor of the ''[[British Critic]]''. He also gave courses of lectures in a side chapel of St Mary's in defence of the ''via media'' (""middle way"") of Anglicanism between Roman Catholicism and popular Protestantism.

===Doubts and opposition===
Newman's influence in Oxford was supreme about the year 1839. Just then, however, his study of [[monophysitism]] raised a doubt whether the Anglican position was really tenable on the principles of ecclesiastical authority which he had accepted. He then read, in [[Nicholas Wiseman]]'s article in the ''[[Dublin Review (Catholic periodical)|Dublin Review]]'' on ""The Anglican Claim,"" the words of [[Augustine of Hippo]] against the [[Donatism|Donatists]], ""''securus judicat orbis terrarum''"" (""the verdict of the world is conclusive""). He later wrote of his reaction,

:For a mere sentence, the words of St Augustine, struck me with a power which I never had felt from any words before ..... they were like the 'Tolle, lege,&nbsp;— Tolle, lege,' of the child, which converted St Augustine himself. 'Securus judicat orbis terrarum!' By those great words of the ancient Father, interpreting and summing up the long and varied course of ecclesiastical history, the theology of the ''Via Media'' was absolutely pulverised. (''Apologia'', part 5)

After a furore in which the eccentric [[John Brande Morris]] preached for him in St Mary's in September 1839, Newman began to think of moving away from Oxford. One plan that surfaced was to set up a religious community in Littlemore, outside the city of Oxford.<ref>Chadwick, p. 178.</ref> He had had a chapel built there, with foundation stone laid by his mother in 1835, based on a half-acre plot and £100 given by Oriel College.<ref>Gilley, p. 142.</ref> His plans for Littlemore had involved bringing in [[Charles Pourtales Golightly]], an Oriel man, as curate, in 1836; but a sermon of Newman's had changed Golightly's views, and brought him into the camp of aggressive anti-Catholics.<ref>{{Cite DNB|wstitle=Golightly, Charles Pourtales}}</ref> [[Isaac Williams]] filled in as curate, and then [[John Rouse Bloxam]] acted as Littlemore curate from 1837 to 1840.<ref>''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Bloxam, John Rouse (1807–1891), antiquary by M. C. Curthoys.</ref> [[William John Copeland]] acted as curate from 1840.<ref>''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Copeland, William John (1804–1885), historian and Church of England clergyman, by K. E. Macnab.</ref>

Newman continued his work, however, as a High Anglican controversialist until he had published, in 1841, [[Tract 90]], in fact to be the last of the series. It was a detailed examination of the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]], suggesting that their negations were not directed against the authorised creed of Roman Catholics, but only against popular errors and exaggerations. This theory, though not altogether new, aroused indignation in Oxford, and [[Archibald Campbell Tait]], with three other senior tutors, denounced it as ""suggesting and opening a way by which men might violate their solemn engagements to the university."" The alarm was shared by the heads of houses and by others in authority; and, at the request of [[Richard Bagot (bishop)|Richard Bagot]], the [[Bishop of Oxford]], the publication of the ''Tracts'' came to an end.

===Retreat to Littlemore===
Newman also resigned the editorship of the ''British Critic'', and was thenceforth, as he later described it, ""on his deathbed as regards membership with the Anglican Church."" He now considered the position of Anglicans to be similar to that of the semi-Arians in the [[Arianism|Arian]] controversy. The joint [[Anglican-German Bishopric in Jerusalem|Anglican-Lutheran bishopric]] set up in [[Jerusalem]] was to him further evidence that the Church of England was not apostolic.<ref>{{Cite DNB|wstitle=Alexander, Michael Solomon}}</ref>

[[File:Newmans College Littlemore 11 Feb 2007.JPG|thumb|right|Newman College, College Lane, Littlemore.]]

In 1842 Newman withdrew to [[Littlemore]], and lived under something like monastic conditions with a small band of followers. The first to join him there was [[John Dobree Dalgairns]].<ref>''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Dalgairns, John Dobrée [name in religion Bernard] (1818–1876), Roman Catholic priest and scholar, by Sheridan Gilley.</ref> Others were [[William Lockhart (priest)|William Lockhart]] on the advice of [[Henry Edward Manning|Henry Manning]],<ref>''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Lockhart, William (1819–1892), Roman Catholic convert and Rosminian priest by G.

Extract from interview with the custodian of Newman's Littlemore, posted Sunday, September 27, 2009. Retrieved 14 December 2010.</ref> The construction work on this ""Anglican monastery"" attracted publicity, and much curiosity in Oxford, which Newman tried to downplay, but the nickname Newmanooth (from [[Maynooth College]]) was given to the development.<ref>Chadwick pp. 193–4.</ref>

Newman assigned the task to some of his [[wikt:disciple|disciples]] of writing of the lives of the English saints, while his time was largely devoted to the completion of an ''Essay on the [[Development of doctrine|development of Christian doctrine]]''. In February 1843, he published, as an advertisement in the ''Oxford Conservative Journal'', an anonymous but otherwise formal retractation of all the hard things he had said against Rome. In September 1843, after Lockhart's conversion to Catholicism, Newman preached his last Anglican sermon at Littlemore and resigned the living of St Mary's.

==Conversion to Roman Catholicism==
An interval of two years then elapsed before Newman was received into the Roman Catholic Church (9 October 1845) by [[Dominic Barberi]], an Italian [[Passionist]], at the College in [[Littlemore]]. The personal consequences for Newman of his conversion were great: he suffered broken relationships with family and friends, attitudes to him within his Oxford circle becoming polarised.<ref>Gilley, pp. 243–5.</ref> The effect on the wider Tractarian movement is still debated, since Newman's leading role is regarded by some scholars as overstated, as is Oxford's domination of the movement as a whole. Tractarian writings had a wide and continuing circulation after 1845, well beyond the range of personal contacts with the main Oxford figures, and Tractarian clergy continued to be recruited into the Church of England in numbers.<ref>Herring, pp. 65–74.</ref>

===Oratorian===
In February 1846, Newman left Oxford for [[St. Mary's College, Oscott|Oscott]], where [[Nicholas Wiseman|Bishop Wiseman]], then vicar-apostolic of the Midland district, resided; and in October he went to Rome, where he was ordained priest by Cardinal [[Giacomo Filippo Fransoni]] and awarded the degree of [[Doctor of Divinity|D.D.]] by [[Pope Pius IX]]. At the close of 1847, Newman returned to England as an [[Oratory of Saint Philip Neri|Oratorian]] and resided first at Maryvale (near [[Old Oscott]]); then at St Wilfrid’s College, [[Cheadle, Staffordshire|Cheadle]]; and then at St Ann's, Alcester Street, [[Birmingham]]. Finally he settled at [[Edgbaston]], where spacious premises were built for the community, and where (except for four years in [[Ireland]]) he lived a secluded life for nearly forty years.

[[File:Statue Cardinal Newman, Brompton Oratory.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Statue outside the [[Church of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], popularly known as Brompton Oratory, in London]]

Before the house at Edgbaston was occupied, Newman established the [[London Oratory]], with Father [[Frederick William Faber]] as its superior.

===Achilli trial===
{{details|Giacinto Achilli}}

At the London Oratory in 1851, Newman delivered a course of lectures on ''The Present Position of Catholics in England''. Largely ignored by the press at the time, they analysed at length traditional views of Catholicism held by Protestants.<ref>Edward Norman, ''The English Catholic Church in the Nineteeth Century'' (1984), p. 204.</ref>  In the fifth of them he protested against the anti-Catholic utterances of [[Giacinto Achilli]], an ex-[[Dominican friar]], whom he accused in detail of numerous acts of immorality.

Popular Protestant feeling ran high at the time, partly in consequence of the bull ''[[Universalis Ecclesiae]]'' and setting up of the Catholic diocesan hierarchy by Pope Pius IX. Criminal proceedings against Newman for libel in the [[Achilli trial#Newman's trial for libel|""Achilli trial""]] in 1852 resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff.<ref>[http://www.newmanreader.org/biography/ward/volume1/chapter10.html Chapter 10. The Achilli Trial (1851–1853)]</ref> Newman was found guilty, and sentenced to pay a fine of £100, while his expenses as defendant amounted to about £14,000. This sum was raised by public subscription; a surplus was spent on the purchase of a small property in [[Rednal]], on the [[Lickey Hills]], with a chapel and cemetery, where Newman was eventually buried.

===Educator===
In 1854, at the request of the Irish Catholic bishops, Newman went to [[Dublin]] as rector of the newly established ''[[Catholic University of Ireland]]'', now [[University College, Dublin]]. It was during this time that he  founded the [[Literary and Historical Society (University College Dublin)|Literary and Historical Society]]. After four years, he retired. He published a volume of lectures entitled ''The Idea of a University'', containing some of his most effective writing:

<blockquote>...the high protecting power of all knowledge and science, of fact and principle, of inquiry and discovery of experiment and speculation...</blockquote>

In 1858, Newman projected a branch house of the Oratory at Oxford; but this project was opposed by Father (later Cardinal) [[Henry Edward Manning]], another influential convert from Anglicanism, and others as likely to induce Catholics to send their sons to that university, and the scheme was abandoned. When Catholics did begin to attend Oxford from the 1860s onwards, a Catholic club was formed and, in 1888, it was renamed the [[Oxford University Newman Society]] in recognition of Newman's efforts on behalf of Catholicism in that university city. The Oxford Oratory was eventually founded over 100 years later in 1993.<ref>[http://www.oxfordoratory.org.uk/ The Oxford Oratory]</ref>

In 1859, Newman established, in connection with the Birmingham Oratory, a school for the education of the sons of gentlemen along lines similar to those of English public schools. [[The Oratory School]] flourished as a boy's boarding school, dubbed as 'The Catholic [[Eton College|Eton]]'.

===Relationships with other converts===
[[File:Newman desk.JPG|thumb|upright|left|250px|Newman's desk in the Birmingham Oratory]]
Newman had a special concern in the publisher [[Burns & Oates]]; the owner, [[James Burns (publisher)|James Burns]], had published some of the Tractarians, and Burns had himself converted to Roman Catholicism in 1847. Newman published several books with the company, effectively saving it. There is even a story that Newman's novel ''[[Loss and Gain]]'' was written specifically to assist Burns.

In 1863, in a response to [[Thomas William Allies]], while agreeing that [[slavery]] was bad, Newman would not publicly condemn it as ""intrinsically evil"" on the grounds that it had been tolerated by St Paul – thus asserting that slavery is ""a condition of life ordained by God in the same sense that other conditions of life are"".<ref>John Noonan, 'A Church That Can and Cannot Change', 2005</ref>

Newman and [[Henry Edward Manning]] both became significant figures in the late 19th century Roman Catholic Church in England: both were Anglican converts and both were elevated to the dignity of cardinal. In spite of these similarities, in fact there was a lack of sympathy between the two men, who were different in character and experience, and they clashed on a number of issues, in particular the foundation of an Oratory in Oxford. On theological issues, Newman is seen as the more liberal because of his reservations about the declaration of [[papal infallibility]] (Manning favoured the formal declaration of the doctrine).

==''Apologia''==
[[File:Newmancofa.png|thumb|right|Newman's personal coat of arms upon his elevation to the cardinalate. The Latin motto, ""COR AD COR LOQVITVR"", translates ""heart speaks unto heart"".]]

In 1862 Newman began to prepare autobiographical and other memoranda to vindicate his career. The occasion came when, in January 1864, [[Charles Kingsley]], reviewing [[James Anthony Froude]]'s ''History of England'' in ''Macmillan’s Magazine'', incidentally asserted that ""Father Newman informs us that truth for its own sake need not be, and on the whole ought not to be, a virtue of the Roman clergy."" [[Edward Lowth Badeley]], who had been a close legal adviser to Newman since the Achilli trial, encouraged him to make a robust rebuttal.<ref name=""courtney"">Courtney (2004)</ref> After some preliminary sparring between the two, Newman published a pamphlet, ''Mr Kingsley and Dr Newman: a Correspondence on the Question whether Dr Newman teaches that Truth is no Virtue,'' (published in 1864 and not reprinted until 1913). The pamphlet has been described as ""unsurpassed in the English language for the vigour of its satire"".<ref name=""eb"">[Anon.] (1911) ""John Henry Newman"" ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''</ref> However, the anger displayed was later, in a letter to Sir William Cope, admitted to have been largely feigned.

Subsequently, again encouraged by Badeley,<ref name=""courtney""/> Newman published in bi-monthly parts his ''[[Apologia Pro Vita Sua]]'', a religious autobiography of abiding interest. Its tone changed the popular estimate of its author, by explaining the convictions which had led him into the Roman Catholic Church. Kingsley's general accusation against the Catholic clergy was not precisely dealt with; a passing sentence, in an appendix on lying and equivocation, maintained that English Catholic priests are as truthful as English Catholic laymen. Newman published a revision of the series of pamphlets in book form in 1865; in 1913 a combined critical edition, edited by [[Wilfrid Ward]], was published.

==Later years==
In 1870, Newman published his ''[[Grammar of Assent]]'', a closely reasoned work in which the case for religious belief is maintained by arguments somewhat different from those commonly used by Roman Catholic theologians of the time. In 1877, in the republication of his Anglican works, he added to the two volumes containing his defence of the ''[[via media]]'', a long preface in which he criticised and replied to anti-Catholic arguments of his own which were contained in the original works.

At the time of the [[First Vatican Council]] (1869–1870), Newman was uneasy about the [[dogmatic definition|formal definition]] of the doctrine of [[papal infallibility]], believing that the time was 'inopportune'.<ref>Connolly, p. 10.</ref> In a private letter to his bishop ([[William Bernard Ullathorne]]), surreptitiously published, he denounced the ""insolent and aggressive faction"" that had pushed the matter forward. Newman gave no sign of disapproval when the doctrine was finally defined, but was an advocate of the ""principle of minimising"", that included very few papal declarations within the scope of infallibility.<ref>Newman, ''Letter to the Duke of Norfolk'', p. 120</ref> Subsequently, in a letter nominally addressed to the [[Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] when [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] accused the Roman Church of having ""equally repudiated modern thought and ancient history,"" Newman affirmed that he had always believed in the doctrine, and had only feared the deterrent effect of its definition on conversions on account of acknowledged historical difficulties. In this letter, and especially in the postscript to the second edition, Newman answered the charge that he was not at ease within the Catholic Church.

In 1878, Newman's old college elected him an honorary fellow, and he revisited Oxford, after an interval of thirty-two years, on the same day [[Pope Pius IX]] died. Pius had mistrusted Newman, but [[Pope Leo XIII]] was encouraged by the Duke of Norfolk and other English Catholic laymen to make Newman a [[Cardinal (Catholic)|cardinal]], despite the fact that he was neither a bishop nor resident in Rome. Cardinal Manning seems not to have been interested in having Newman become a cardinal, and remained silent when the Pope asked him about it; Bishop Ullathorne, as Newman's immediate superior, sent word to Leo that he would welcome the honour. The offer was made in February 1879. Newman accepted the gesture as a vindication of his work, but made two requests: that he not be consecrated a bishop on receiving the cardinalate (as was standard procedure); and that he might remain in Birmingham.

Newman's elevation to the rank of cardinal took place on 12 May, making him [[Cardinal-Deacon]] of ''[[San Giorgio al Velabro]]''. Newman while in Rome insisted on the lifelong consistency of his opposition to ""liberalism in religion.""

==Death==
After an illness, Newman returned to England and lived at the Oratory until his death, making occasional visits to London and chiefly to his old friend, [[Richard William Church|R. W. Church]], now [[Dean of St Paul's]]. As a cardinal, Newman published nothing beyond a preface to a work by [[Arthur Wollaston Hutton]] on the Anglican Ministry (1879) and an article ""On the Inspiration of Scripture"" in ''The Nineteenth Century'' (February 1884).

From the latter half of 1886, Newman's health began to fail, and he celebrated Mass for the last time on [[Christmas Day]] in 1889. On 11 August 1890,<small><ref name=CEnc/></small> he died of [[pneumonia]] at the Birmingham Oratory. Eight days later, his body was buried in the cemetery at [[Rednal]] Hill, [[Birmingham]], at the country house of the Oratory. At the time of his death, he had been [[Protodeacon]] of the Holy Roman Church.

In accordance with his express wishes, Newman was buried in the grave of his lifelong friend, [[Ambrose St. John]].<small><ref name=CEnc/></small> The pall over the coffin bore the motto that Newman adopted for use as a cardinal, ''Cor ad cor loquitur'' (""Heart speaks to heart""),<ref>[http://www.newmanfriendsinternational.org/newman/?p=123 ''Cor ad cor loquitur'': John Henry Newman's Coat of Arms]</ref> which William Barry, writing in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (1913), traces to [[Francis de Sales]] and sees as revealing the secret of Newman's ""eloquence, unaffected, graceful, tender, and penetrating"".<ref name=CEnc/>  Ambrose St. John had become a Roman Catholic at around the same time as Newman, and the two men have a joint memorial stone inscribed with the motto Newman had chosen, ''Ex umbris et imaginibus in veritatem'' (""Out of shadows and phantasms into the truth""),<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/herefordandworcester/content/articles/2008/07/18/cardinal_newman_feature.shtml Faith Features: John Henry Newman]</ref> which Barry traces to [[Plato's allegory of the cave]].<ref name=CEnc/>

On 27 February 1891, Newman's estate was probated at £4,206.

==Missing relics==

Newman's grave was opened on 2 October 2008, with the intention of moving any remains to a tomb inside [[Birmingham Oratory]] for their more convenient veneration as [[relics]]<ref name=Duffy/> during Newman's consideration for [[sainthood]]; however, his wooden coffin was found to have disintegrated and no bones were found. Peter Jennings from the Fathers of the Birmingham Oratory claimed this was because the coffin was wooden and the burial took place at a damp site.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7672099.stm Mystery of cardinal's missing bones], ''BBC News'', 29 October 2008.</ref> Contemporary sources show that the coffin was covered with a softer type of soil than the clay marl of the grave site.<ref>{{cite book |title=John Henry Newman: A Biography |last=Ker |first=Ian |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-956910-6 |page=747 |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/?id=6Ufe355ZVMEC&pg=PA747&dq=Cardinal+Newman+funeral+soil#v=onepage&q=Cardinal%20Newman%20funeral%20soil&f=false |accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref> Forensic expert Professor John Hunter, from the University of Birmingham, tested soil samples from near the grave and said that total disappearance of a body was most unlikely over that timescale.

==Writer==
Some of Newman's short and earlier poems are described by [[Richard Holt Hutton|R. H. Hutton]] as ""unequalled for grandeur of outline, purity of taste and radiance of total effect""; while his latest and longest, ''[[The Dream of Gerontius (poem)|The Dream of Gerontius]]'', attempts to represent the unseen world along the same lines as [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]. His prose style, especially in his Catholic days, is fresh and vigorous, and is attractive to many who do not sympathise with his conclusions, from the apparent candour with which difficulties are admitted and grappled; while in his private correspondence there is charm. [[James Joyce]] had a lifelong admiration for Newman's writing, and in a letter to his patron [[Harriet Shaw Weaver]] humorously remarked about Newman that ""nobody has ever written English prose that can be compared with that of a tiresome footling little Anglican parson who afterwards became a prince of the only true church"".<ref>{{Cite book|last =Ellmann|first = Richard| authorlink = Richard Ellmann| title = James Joyce| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 1982| location =Oxford| page = 40| isbn = 978-0-19-503381-6}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| last = Joyce| first = James| authorlink = James Joyce | coauthors = Richard Ellmann, ed.| title = Selected Letters of James Joyce | publisher = Faber & Faber | year = 1975| location = London | page =375| isbn = 978-0-571-10734-6}}</ref>

==Theologian==
Around 1830, Newman developed a distinction between [[natural religion]] and [[revealed religion]]. Revealed religion is the [[Judeo-Christian]] revelation which finds its fulfilment in [[Jesus Christ]]. Natural religion refers to the knowledge of God and divine things that has been acquired outside the Judeo-Christian revelation. For Newman, this knowledge of God is not the result of unaided reason but of reason aided by [[divine grace|grace]], and so he speaks of natural religion as containing a revelation, even though it is an incomplete revelation.<ref>Connolly, p. 48.</ref>

Newman's view of natural religion gives rise to passages in his writings in which he appears to sympathise with a broader theology. Both as an Anglican and as a Catholic, he put forward the notion of a universal revelation. As an Anglican, Newman subscribed to this notion in various works, among them the 1830 University Sermon entitled ""The Influence of Natural and Revealed Religion Respectively"", the 1833 poem ""Heathenism"",<ref>[http://www.newmanreader.org/works/verses/verse76.html ""Heathenism""]</ref> and the book ''The Arians of the Fourth Century'', also 1833, where he admits that there was ""something true and divinely revealed in every religion"".<ref>[http://www.newmanreader.org/works/arians/chapter1-3.html ''The Arians of the Fourth Century'': Chapter I, Section 3]</ref>  As a Catholic, he included the idea in ''A Grammar of Assent'': ""As far as we know, there never was a time when...revelation was not a revelation continuous and systematic, with distinct representatives and an orderly succession.""<ref>Connolly, pp. 140–141.</ref>

Newman held that ""freedom from symbols and articles is abstractedly the highest state of Christian communion"", but was ""the peculiar privilege of the primitive Church."" <ref>[http://www.newmanreader.org/works/arians/chapter1-2.html#return24 ''The Arians of the Fourth Century'': Chapter I, Section 2]</ref> In 1877 he allowed that ""in a religion that embraces large and separate classes of adherents there always is of necessity to a certain extent an exoteric and an esoteric doctrine.""<ref>[http://www.newmanreader.org/works/viamedia/volume1/preface3.html ''Lectures on the Prophetical Office of the Church'': Preface to the Third Edition]</ref>

==Character and relationships==
[[File:Newman2.JPG|Newman's room in the Birmingham Oratory.|thumb|150px|left]]

A recent biography of Newman notes that since his death in 1890 he has suffered almost as much misrepresentation as he did during his lifetime. In the ''Apologia'' he had exorcised the phantom which, as he said, ""gibbers instead of me"" — the phantom of the secret Romanist, corrupting the youth of Oxford, devious and dissimulating. But he raised another phantom — that of the oversensitive, self-absorbed recluse<ref name=""T&C p54"">[[Meriol Trevor]] and Léonie Caldecott. ''John Henry Newman: Apostle to the Doubtful''.

In Newman's letters and memoranda and those of his friends, a more outgoing and humorous character is revealed.<ref name=""T&C p54""/> Newman lived in the world of his time, travelling by train as soon as trains came in and writing amusing letters about his adventures on railways<ref name=""T&C p56"">Trevor and Caldecott, p. 56.</ref> and ships or during his travels in Scotland and Ireland.<ref name=""T&C p57""/> He was an indefatigable walker, and as a young don at Oriel he often went out riding with Hurrell Froude and other friends.<ref>Trevor and Caldecott, p. 55.</ref> At Oxford he had an active pastoral life, though nothing of it appears in the ''Apologia'', and later he was active as a Catholic priest.<ref name=""T&C p57""/> His Oratory parishioners, apart from a few professional men and their families, were mainly factory workers, Irish immigrants, and tradespeople. He was a caring pastor, and their recorded reminiscences show that they held him in affection.<ref>Trevor and Caldecott, p. 58.</ref>

Newman, who was only a few years younger than [[Keats]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], was born into the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] generation, when Englishmen still wept in moments of emotion. But he lived on into the age of the [[stiff upper lip]], with the result that later generations, hearing of his tears on a visit to his mother's grave or at the funerals of old friends such as [[Henry Wilberforce]], thought him not only sensitive but melancholy.<ref>Trevor and Caldecott, pp. 60–61.</ref>

The ""sensitive recluse of legend""<ref name=""T&C p56""/> had a wide currency, appearing, for instance, in [[Lytton Strachey]]'s description of Newman's  ""soft, spectacled, Oxford manner, with its half-effeminate diffidence"".<ref>Lytton Strachey, ''Eminent Victorians'', 1918, p. 69. [[:s:Eminent Victorians/Cardinal Manning#VI]]. The full sentence reads: ""His delicate mind, with its refinements, its hesitations, its complexities—his soft, spectacled, Oxford manner, with its half-effeminate diffidence- such things were ill calculated to impress a throng of busy Cardinals and Bishops, whose days were spent amid the practical details of ecclesiastical organisation, the long-drawn involutions of papal diplomacy, and the delicious bickerings of personal intrigue.""</ref> [[Geoffrey Faber]], whose own account of Newman in ''Oxford Apostles'' was far from [[hagiographic]], found Strachey's portrait a distasteful caricature, bearing scant likeness to the Newman of history and designed solely ""to tickle the self-conceit of a cynical and beliefless generation"".<ref>Geoffrey Faber, ''Oxford Apostles: A Character Study of the Oxford Movement'', London 1933.</ref>

Strachey was only ten when Newman died and never met him. In contrast to Strachey's caricature, [[James Anthony Froude]], Hurrell Froude's brother, who knew Newman at Oxford, saw him as a [[Heroes and Hero-Worship|Carlylean hero]].<ref name=""Adams p82"">James Eli Adams. ''Dandies and Desert Saints: Styles of Victorian Masculinity''. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1995, p. 82. ISBN 978-0-8014-8208-3.</ref> Compared with Newman, Froude wrote, Keble, Pusey and the other Tractarians ""were all but as [[Names for the number 0 in English|ciphers]], and he the indicating number"". Newman's face was ""remarkably like that of [[Julius Caesar]].... I have often thought of the resemblance, and believed that it extended to the temperament. In both there was an original force of character which refused to be moulded by circumstances, which was to make its own way, and become a power in the world; a clearness of intellectual perception, a disdain for conventionalities, a temper imperious and wilful, but along with it a most attaching gentleness, sweetness, singleness of heart and purpose. Both were formed by nature to command others, both had the faculty of attracting to themselves the passionate devotion of their friends and followers.... For hundreds of young men ''Credo in Newmannum'' was the veritable symbol of faith.""<ref>Quoted in Wilfred Ward, [http://www.newmanreader.org/biography/ward-genius/lecture1.html ''The Genius of Cardinal Newman'': Lecture 1]</ref>

===Celibacy===
Newman's [[Clerical celibacy|celibacy]], which he embraced at the age of 15,<ref name=CEnc/> also contributed to negative representations of his character,<ref>Oliver S. Buckton. ''Secret Selves: Confession and Same-Sex Desire in Victorian Autobiography''. University of North Carolina Press, 1998, p. 31. ISBN 978-0-8078-4702-2.</ref> laying him open to what he called ""slurs"".<ref>Meriol Trevor. ''Newman's Journey'', Fontana Library, 1974, p. 23.</ref> To exponents of [[Muscular Christianity]] such as Charles Kingsley, celibacy was synonymous with unmanliness. Kingsley, who interpreted the Biblical story of [[Adam and Eve]] as expressing a ""binary law of man's being; the want of a complementum, a 'help meet', without whom it is not good for him to be"",<ref>Frances Eliza Kingsley (ed.), ''Charles Kingsley: His Letters and Memories of His Life, Vol. I''. New York: Fred De Fau, 1899, p. 162. Kingsley here cites Genesis 2:18. ([[KJV]]: ""And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help met for him."")</ref> feared and hated vowed sexual abstinence, considering it, in Laura Fasick's words, ""a distinct and separate perversion"".<ref>Laura Fasick. ""The Seduction of Celibacy: Threats to Male Sexual Identity in Charles Kingsley's Writings"", in Jay Losey and William D. Brewer (eds), ''Mapping Male Sexuality: Nineteenth-Century England''. Madison, NJ: Farleigh Dickinson University Press, 2000, p. 225. ISBN 978-0-8386-3828-6.</ref> The charge of effeminacy was aimed not just at Newman but at Tractarians and Roman Catholics in general. ""In all that school,"" wrote Kingsley in 1851, ""there is an element of foppery — even in dress and manner; a fastidious, maundering, die-away effeminacy, which is mistaken for purity and refinement.""<ref>Francis Eliza Kingsley (ed.), ''Charles Kingsley, Vol. I'', pp. 217–218.</ref> [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]] comments that ""the notion of Newman's effeminacy tells us more about the reaction of others to him at the time than (about) any tendency in his own nature.""<ref>John Cornwell. ""Comment (10.10.10)"" on a misleading citation from his biography, ''Newman's Unquiet Grave: The Reluctant Saint'' (London: Continuum, 2010) in Jonathan Aitken, [http://spectator.org/archives/2010/09/15/a-saintly-conscience ""A Saintly Conscience""], ''[[The American Spectator]]'', September 2010.</ref>

To many members of the Oxford Movement, Newman included, it was Kingsley's ideal of domesticity that seemed unmanly. As [[R. W. Church]] put it, ""To shrink from [celibacy] was a mark of want of strength or intelligence, of an unmanly preference for English home life, of insensibility to the generous devotion and purity of the saints.""<ref>R. W. Church. [http://anglicanhistory.org/england/church/om/18.html ''The Oxford Movement: Twelve Years 1833–1845'': Chapter XVIII]</ref>
Defending his decision to remain single, Charles Reding, the hero of Newman's novel ''Loss and Gain'', argues that ""surely the idea of an Apostle, unmarried, pure, in fast and nakedness, and at length a [[martyr]], is a higher idea than that of one of the old Israelites sitting under his vine and fig-tree, full of temporal goods, and surrounded by sons and grandsons?""<ref>Newman, [http://www.newmanreader.org/works/gain/chapter2-5.html ''Loss and Gain'': Part I, Chapter 5]</ref> If manliness is equated with physical and psychological toughness, then perhaps, as James Eli Adams observes, ""manhood cannot be ''sustained'' within domesticity, since the ideal is incompatible with ease.""<ref>Adams, ''Dandies and Desert Saints'', p. 10.</ref> A ""common antagonism to domesticity"" links ""Tractarian discipline to Carlylean heroism"".<ref name=""Adams p82""/>

===Friendships===
Although Newman's deepest relationships were with men, he had many affectionate friendships with women.<ref>Joyce Sugg. ''Ever Yours Affly: John Henry Newman and His Female Circle''. Gracewing, 1996. ISBN 978-0-85244-315-6.</ref> One of the most important was with Maria Giberne, who knew him in his youth and followed him into the Catholic Church. She was a noted beauty, who even at fifty was described by one admirer as ""the handsomest woman I ever saw in my life"".<ref>[[Thomas Mozley]]. ''Reminiscences: Chiefly of Oriel College and the Oxford Movement, Volume 2''. London: Longmans, Green and Co., 1882, p. 44.</ref> A gifted amateur artist, she painted many portraits of Newman at various periods, as well as several of the pictures hanging in the Birmingham Oratory. Newman had a photo of her in his room<ref>[http://www.newliturgicalmovement.org/2009/07/cardinal-newman-at-birmingham-his-study.html Cardinal Newman's Room at Birmingham]</ref> and was still corresponding with her into their eighties. Emily Bowles, who first met Newman at Littlemore, was the recipient of some of his most outspoken letters on what he felt to be the mistaken course of the extreme infallibilists and his reasons for not ""speaking out"" as many begged him to do.<ref>Trevor and Caldecott, p. 59.</ref>
When she visited Newman at the Birmingham Oratory in 1861, she was welcomed by him ""as only he can welcome""; she would never forget ""the brightness that lit up his worn face as he received me at the door, carrying in several packages himself"".<ref>Trevor, ''Newman's Journey'', p. 202.</ref>

Men born in the first decades of the nineteenth century had a capacity for intense male friendships that did not survive into later generations. The friendship of [[Alfred Tennyson]] and [[Arthur Hallam]], immortalized in ''[[In Memoriam A.H.H.]]'', is the most famous example. Less well-known is that of Charles Kingsley and his closest friend at Cambridge, Charles Mansfield.<ref>Buckton, pp. 36–37.</ref> Newman, too, experienced such friendships, the first with [[Richard Hurrell Froude]] (1803–1836), the longest with [[Ambrose St John]] (1815–1875), who shared communitarian life with Newman for 32 years from 1843 (when St John was 28).<ref>J. H. Rigg, ''Oxford High Anglicanism and its Chief Leader''s, London, 1895.</ref> Newman wrote after St John's death: ""I have ever thought no bereavement was equal to that of a husband's or a wife's, but I feel it difficult to believe that any can be greater, or any one's sorrow greater, than mine.""<ref>Charles Dessain. ''The Letters and Diaries of John Henry Newman Volume IX: Littlemore and the Parting of Friends May 1842–October 1843''. London: Thomas Nelson & Sons.</ref> He directed that he be buried in the same grave as St. John: ""I wish, with all my heart, to be buried in Fr Ambrose St John's grave&nbsp;— and I give this as my last, my imperative will.""<ref>Newman, ""Written in prospect of death"", July 23, 1876, in [http://www.newmanreader.org/works/meditations/meditations12.html ''Meditations and Devotions'' — Part 3]</ref>

Newman spelt out his theology of friendship in a sermon he preached on the Feast of St [[John the Evangelist]], traditionally thought to be the same person as [[John the Apostle|the disciple John]], ""whom Jesus loved"". In the sermon, Newman said: ""There have been men before now, who have supposed Christian love was so diffuse as not to admit of concentration upon individuals; so that we ought to love all men equally.... Now I shall maintain here, in opposition to such notions of Christian love, and with our Saviour's pattern before me, that the best preparation for loving the world at large, and loving it duly and wisely, is to cultivate our intimate friendship and affection towards those who are immediately about us.""<ref>Newman, [http://www.newmanreader.org/works/parochial/volume2/sermon5.html ""Love of Relations and Friends""], ''Parochial and Plain Sermons'', Volume 2, Sermon 5.</ref> For Newman, friendship is an intimation of a greater love, a foretaste of heaven. In friendship, two intimate friends gain a glimpse of the life that awaits them in God.<ref name=Vernon>[[Mark Vernon]]. [http://www.templeton-cambridge.org/fellows/showarticle.php?article=417 ""One Soul, Two Bodies""]. ''[[The Tablet]]'', 3 April 2010.</ref> Juan R. Vélez writes that someday Newman ""may well earn a new title, that of ''Doctor amicitiae'': [[Doctor of the Church]] on Friendship. His biography is a treatise on the human and supernatural virtues that make up friendship.""<ref>Juan R. Vélez. [http://www.mercatornet.com/articles/view/heart_speaks_to_heart ""Heart speaks to heart""]. ''[[MercatorNet]]'', 9 September 2010.</ref>

===Issues of sexual identity===
In his 1933 book ''Oxford Apostles'', Geoffrey Faber, as David Hilliard observes, offered a ""portrait of Newman as a [[sublimation (psychology)|sublimated]] homosexual (though the word itself was not used)"".<ref>David Hilliard. [http://anglicanhistory.org/academic/hilliard_unenglish.pdf ""UnEnglish and Unmanly: Anglo-Catholicism and Homosexuality""], p. 4. Originally published in ''Victorian Studies'', Winter 1982, pp. 181–210.</ref> On Newman's relations with Hurrell Froude, Faber wrote: ""Of all his friends Froude filled the deepest place in his heart, and I'm not the first to point out that his occasional notions of marrying definitely ceased with the beginning of his real intimacy with Froude.""<ref>''Oxford Apostles'', p. 218 of the Pelican (1954) edition.</ref> However, while Faber's theory has had considerable popular influence, scholars of the Oxford Movement tend either to dismiss it entirely or to view it with great scepticism,<ref>Buckton (p. 36) cites [[Piers Brendon]] and Sheridan Gilley as scholars who dismiss Faber's theory.</ref> with even scholars specifically concerned with same-sex desire hesitating to endorse it.<ref>Buckton (p. 30) cautions: ""We ought, of course, to be wary of repeating [Charles] Kingsley's obsessive practice of eroticizing every aspect of Newman's life and faith.""</ref>

Ellis Hanson, for instance, writes that Newman and Froude clearly ""presented a challenge to Victorian [[gender norms]]"", but ""Faber's reading of Newman's sexlessness<ref>Faber's book came out in 1933. Later research by Ker (see below) and others does not support the idea of Newman's ""sexlessness"".</ref> and Hurrell Froude's guilt<ref>As Hilliard notes (p. 5), Piers Brendon, in his biography of Froude, offers a very different interpretation of Froude's sense of guilt.</ref> as evidence of homosexuality"" seems ""strained"".<ref>Ellis Hanson. ''Decadence and Catholicism''. Harvard University Press, 1998, p. 254.</ref> When [[John Campbell Shairp]] combines masculine and feminine imagery in his highly poetic description of Newman's preaching style at Oxford in the early 1840s, Frederick S. Roden is put in mind of ""the late Victorian definition of a male invert, the homosexual: his (Newman's) [[homiletics]] suggest a woman's soul in a man's body.""<ref>Frederick S. Roden. ''Same-Sex Desire in Victorian Religious Culture''. Palgrave MacMillan, 2003, p. 16. ISBN 978-0-333-98643-1. In the passage cited by Roden, Shairp describes the style of Newman's sermons as ""so simple and transparent, yet so subtle withal; so strong yet so tender; the grasp of a strong man's hand, combined with the trembling of a woman's heart...laying the most penetrating finger on the very core of things"".</ref> Roden, however, does not argue that Newman was homosexual, seeing him rather — particularly in his [[Profession (religious)|professed]] celibacy<ref>Roden, pp. 4, 6, 13–14.</ref> — as a ""cultural dissident"" or ""queer""<ref>Roden uses the term ""[[Queer theory|queer]]"" in a very general sense ""to include any dissonant behaviours, discourses or claimed identities"" (p. 1).</ref> in relation to Victorian norms. In the same sense, ""Victorian Roman and [[Anglo-Catholicism]] were culturally queer"".<ref>Roden, p. 2.</ref> In Newman's case, Roden writes, ""homoaffectivity"" (found in heterosexuals and homosexuals alike)<ref>Roden, p. 1. Roden here explicitly follows [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]], whose term ""[[homosociality]]"" he uses in the sense of ""homosociability or homoaffectivity"" (p. 7).</ref> ""is contained in friendships, in relationships that are not overtly sexual"".<ref>Roden, p. 7.</ref>

In a September 2010 television documentary, ""The Trouble with the Pope"",<ref>''The Trouble with the Pope'', [[Channel 4]], 13 September 2010.</ref> [[Peter Tatchell]] discussed Newman's underlying sexuality, citing his close friendship with Ambrose St John and entries in Newman's diaries describing their intense love for each other.<ref>Peter Tatchell. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/tvandradioblog/2010/sep/13/peter-tatchell-trouble-with-the-pope ""The Trouble with the Pope: a journey into my own preconceptions""], ''guardian.co.uk'', 13 September 2010.</ref><ref>John Cornwell.

''The Friend''. University of Chicago Press, 2003</ref> saw the bond between the two men as ""entirely spiritual""<ref name=BrayTablet>Alan Bray. [http://www.thetablet.co.uk/article/5030 ""Wedded Friendships""], ''The Tablet'', 8 August 2001.</ref>, noting that Newman, when speaking of St John, echoes the language of [[Gospel of John|John's gospel]].<ref name=Vernon/> Shortly after St John's death, Bray adds, Newman recorded ""a conversation between them before St John lost his speech in those final days. He expressed his hope, Newman wrote, that during his whole priestly life he had not committed one [[mortal sin]]. For men of their time and culture that statement is definitive.... Newman's burial with Ambrose St John cannot be detached from his understanding of the place of friendship in Christian belief or its long history."" Bray cites numerous examples of friends being buried together.<ref name=BrayTablet/> Newman's burial with St John was not unusual at the time and did not draw contemporary comment.<ref>Ian Ker. ""Newman, John Henry (1801–1890), theologian and cardinal"", in ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''.</ref>

David Hilliard writes that relationships such as Newman's with Froude and St John ""were not regarded by contemporaries as unnatural.... Nor is it possible, on the basis of passionate words uttered by mid-Victorians, to make a clear distinction between male affection and homosexual feeling. Theirs was a generation prepared to accept [[romantic friendship]]s between men simply as friendships without sexual significance. Only with the emergence in the late nineteenth century of the doctrine of the stiff-upper-lip, and the concept of homosexuality as an identifiable condition, did open expressions of love between men become suspect and regarded in a new light as morally undesirable.""<ref>Hilliard, pp. 4–5.</ref>

When Ian Ker reissued his biography of Newman in 2009, he added an Afterword<ref>Ian Ker. ''John Henry Newman: A Biography''. Oxford University Press, 2009, pp. 746–750.</ref> in which he put forward evidence that Newman was a heterosexual. He cited diary entries from December 1816 in which the 15-year-old Newman wrote about the temptations awaiting him when he returned home from boarding school and met girls at Christmas parties.<ref name=diaries>Simon Caldwell. [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Newman+was+not+gay%3B+Cardinal's+secret+teenage+diaries+show+he+feared...-a0203237435 ""Newman was not gay; Cardinal's secret diaries show he feared being tempted by party girls""], ''[[The Daily Mail]]'', 7 July 2009.</ref> As an adult, Newman wrote about the deep pain of the ""sacrifice"" of the life of celibacy. Ker comments: ""The only 'sacrifice' that he could possibly be referring to was that of marriage. And he readily acknowledges that from time to time he continued to feel the natural attraction for marriage that any heterosexual man would.""<ref>Simon Caldwell. [http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/articles/a0000555.shtml ""Biographer challenges Newman revisionists""], ''[[The Catholic Herald]]'', 29 May 2009.</ref> In 1833, Newman wrote that, despite having ""willingly"" accepted the call to celibacy, he felt ""not the less...the need"" of ""the sort of interest [sympathy]<ref>In the passage quoted from (cited in Ker, ''John Henry Newman: A Biography'', p. 197), ""interest"", ""affectionate interest"" and ""sympathy"" are used interchangeably.</ref> which a wife takes and none but she — it is a woman's interest"".<ref>Ian Ker.

==Influence and legacy==
[[File:Newman room1.JPG|Newman's private chapel in his room|thumb|right]]

Within both the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches, Newman's influence was great in [[dogma]]. For the Roman Catholic Church in Britain, Newman's conversion secured prestige. On Catholics, his influence was mainly in the direction of a broader spirit and of a recognition of the part played by [[Development of doctrine|development]], in doctrine and in church government. In his judgment, spiritual truth is apprehended by direct intuition, as an antecedent to the professedly purely rational basis of Catholic belief.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

If his teaching on the Church was less widely followed, it was because of doubts as to the thoroughness of his knowledge of history and as to his freedom from bias as a critic. Some hundreds of clergymen influenced by the Oxford Movement, made submission to the [[Holy See]]; but a larger number, who also came under its influence, did not accept that belief in the Church necessitated acceptance of the Pope.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Tertiary education===
The university which Newman founded, the [[Catholic University of Ireland]], evolved into [[University College, Dublin]], a college of Ireland's largest university, the [[National University of Ireland]], which has contributed significantly to the intellectual and social development of that country.

A number of Newman Societies (or [[Newman Centers]] in the United States) in Newman's honour have been established throughout the world, in the mould of the [[Oxford University Newman Society]]. They provide pastoral services and ministries to Catholics at non-Catholic universities; at various times this type of ""campus ministry"" (the distinction and definition being flexible) has been known to Catholics as the Newman Apostolate or ""Newman movement"".

Newman's [[Dublin]] lecture series ''The Idea of a University Defined and Illustrated'' is thought to have become ""the basis of a characteristic British belief that education should aim at producing generalists rather than narrow specialists, and that non-vocational subjects – in arts or pure science – could train the mind in ways applicable to a wide range of jobs.""<ref name=""historyandpolicy"">{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-98.html|title=The 'Idea of a University' today|last=Anderson|first=Robert|date=March 2010|work=History & Policy|publisher=History & Policy|accessdate=9 December 2010|location=[[United Kingdom]]}}</ref>

==Cause for his canonisation==
{{Main|Canonization of John Henry Newman}}

In 1991, Newman was proclaimed [[venerable]] after a thorough examination of his life and work by the [[Sacred Congregation for the Causes of Saints]].<ref name=HRCNewman/> One miracle was investigated and confirmed by the [[Holy See|Vatican]], so he was [[beatified]] on 19 September 2010 by Pope Benedict XVI. A second miracle is necessary for his [[canonisation]].

33,b,Karp–Lipton theorem,computer science,"The '''Karp–Lipton theorem''' in [[complexity theory]] states that if the [[boolean satisfiability problem]] (SAT) can be solved by [[Boolean circuit]]s with a [[polynomial]] number of logic gates, then 

:<math>\Pi_2 \,</math> = <math>\Sigma_2 \,</math> and therefore <math>\mathrm{PH} \,</math> = <math>\Sigma_2 \,</math>.

That is, if we assume that [[NP (complexity)|NP]], the class of nondeterministic polynomial time problems, can be contained in the non-uniform polynomial time complexity class [[P/poly]], then this assumption implies the collapse of the [[polynomial hierarchy]] at its second level. Such a collapse is believed unlikely, so the theorem is generally viewed by complexity theorists as evidence for the nonexistence of polynomial size circuits for SAT or for other [[NP-complete]] problems. A proof that such circuits do not exist would imply that [[P = NP problem|P ≠ NP]]. As P/poly contains all problems solvable in randomized polynomial time (Adleman 1978), the Karp–Lipton theorem is also evidence that the use of randomization does not lead to polynomial time algorithms for NP-complete problems.

The Karp–Lipton theorem is named after [[Richard M. Karp]] and [[Richard J. Lipton]], who first proved it in 1980.

== Intuition ==

Suppose that polynomial sized circuits for SAT not only exist, but also that they could be constructed by a polynomial time algorithm. Then this supposition implies that SAT itself could be solved by a polynomial time algorithm that constructs the circuit and then applies it. That is, efficiently constructable circuits for SAT would lead to a stronger collapse, P = NP.

The assumption of the Karp–Lipton theorem, that these circuits exist, is weaker. But it is still possible for an algorithm in the complexity class <math>\Sigma_2</math> to ''guess'' a correct circuit for SAT. The complexity class <math>\Sigma_2</math> describes problems of the form
:<math>\exists x\forall y\;\psi(x,y)</math>
where <math>\psi</math> is any polynomial-time computable predicate. The existential power of the first quantifier in this predicate can be used to guess a correct circuit for SAT, and the universal power of the second quantifier can be used to verify that the circuit is correct. Once this circuit is guessed and verified, the algorithm in class <math>\Sigma_2</math> can use it as a subroutine for solving other problems.

== Self-reducibility ==



To understand the Karp–Lipton proof in more detail, we consider the problem of testing whether a circuit ''c'' is a correct circuit for solving SAT instances of a given size, and show that this circuit testing problem belongs to <math>\Pi_1</math>. That is, there exists a polynomial time computable predicate ''V'' such that ''c'' is a correct circuit if and only if, for all polynomially-bounded ''z'', ''V''(''c'',''z'') is true.

The circuit ''c'' is a correct circuit for SAT if it satisfies two properties:
*For every pair (''s'',''x'') where ''s'' is an instance of SAT and ''x'' is a solution to the instance, ''c''(''s'') must be true
*For every instance ''s'' of SAT for which ''c''(''s'') is true, ''s'' must be solvable.
The first of these two properties is already in the form of problems in class <math>\Pi_1</math>. To verify the second property, we use the ''self-reducibility'' property of SAT.

Self-reducibility describes the phenomenon that, if we can quickly test whether a SAT instance is solvable, we can almost as quickly find an explicit solution to the instance. To find a solution to an instance ''s'', choose one of the Boolean variables ''x'' that is input to ''s'', and make two smaller instances ''s''<sub>0</sub> and ''s''<sub>1</sub> where ''s''<sub>''i''</sub> denotes the formula formed by replacing ''x'' with the constant ''i''. Once these two smaller instances have been constructed, apply the test for solvability to each of them. If one of these two tests returns that the smaller instance is satisfiable, continue solving that instance until a complete solution has been derived.

To use self-reducibility to check the second property of a correct circuit for SAT, we rewrite it as follows:
*For every instance ''s'' of SAT for which ''c''(''s'') is true, the self-reduction procedure described above finds a valid solution to ''s''.

Thus, we can test in <math>\Pi_1</math> whether ''c'' is a valid circuit for solving SAT.

see [[Random_self-reducibility]] for more information

== Proof of Karp–Lipton theorem ==

The Karp–Lipton theorem can be restated as a result about Boolean formulas with polynomially-bounded quantifiers. Problems in <math>\Pi_2</math> are described by formulas of this type, with the syntax
:<math>\phi = \forall x \exists y \; \psi(x, y)</math>
where <math>\psi</math> is a polynomial-time computable predicate. The Karp–Lipton theorem states that this type of formula can be transformed in polynomial time into an equivalent formula in which the quantifiers appear in the opposite order; such a formula belongs to <math>\Sigma_2</math>. Note that the subformula
:<math>s(x)=\exists y \; \psi(x, y)</math>
is an instance of SAT. That is, if ''c'' is a valid circuit for SAT, then this subformula is equivalent to the unquantified formula ''c''(''s''(''x'')). Therefore, the full formula for <math>\phi</math> is equivalent (under the assumption that a valid circuit ''c'' exists) to the formula
:<math>\exists c\forall (x,z)\;V(c,z)\wedge c(s(x))</math>
where ''V'' is the formula used to verify that ''c'' really is a valid circuit using self-reducibility, as described above. This equivalent formula has its quantifiers in the opposite order, as desired. Therefore, the Karp–Lipton assumption allows us to transpose the order of existential and universal quantifiers in formulas of this type, showing that <math>\Sigma_2=\Pi_2.</math> Repeating the transposition allows formulas with deeper nesting to be simplified to a form in which they have a single existential quantifier followed by a single universal quantifier, showing that <math>PH=\Sigma_2.</math>

{{nihongo|'''''Battle Circuit'''''|BATTLE CIRCUIT|Batoru Saakitto}} is an [[action game|action]] ""[[beat 'em up]]"" [[video game|game]] developed and published by [[Capcom]] for the [[CPS-2]] [[arcade machine|arcade]] [[hardware]] for [[Japan]] and [[Europe]] in 1997.  Taking place in an alternate future earth, the game revolves around a group of [[bounty hunters]] who must capture the [[mad scientist]] Dr. Saturn and secure a sophisticated computer disc carrying a program known as the ""[[Shiva]] System"".  The game contains [[comic book|comic]]-like characters in a futuristic [[science fiction]] setting.

==Development==
''Battle Circuit'' was developed by producers Noritaka Funamizo and Yoshiki Okamoto of Capcom's arcade production team in early 1997.<ref name=credits> In-game credits for ''Battle Circuit'', English-language version. 1997</ref>  While structurally very similar to the company's early scrolling action games like ''[[Final Fight]]'' and ''[[Alien vs. Predator (arcade game)|Alien vs. Predator]]'', ''Battle Circuit'' is set apart stylistically by employing a [[manga]]-style [[science fiction|sci-fi]] approach to story and character artwork.  The art staff, overseen by Ohnishi Hiroki and Yamamoto Kouji,<ref name=credits> In-game credits for ''Battle Circuit'', English-language version. 1997</ref> created an assortment of characters with features reminiscent of older Capcom characters and superfluous [[comic book]] elements.  

The game saw a speedy translation effort that effectively made the title available in both Japan and parts of Europe on the same day.  Though there are no game play differences between the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[English language]] versions of the game, a few pieces of Japanese dialogue were omitted from the European release.  The game was not released in [[North America|North American]] arcades or any other part of the world after its initial release.<ref name=vgmuseum> ""[http://www.vgmuseum.com/images/arcade3/03/3.htm Battle Circuit Arcade Info]"" ''VGMuseum''. URL Accessed on [[November 19]], [[2006]].</ref>

==Game play==
[[Image:battle circuit.jpg|left|thumb|225px|In-game screenshot of ''Battle Circuit'' with four players.]]
''Battle Circuit'''s [[arcade cabinet]] provided support for up to four simultaneous players who can each assume the role of five possible characters.<ref name=klov> ""[http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7038 Battle Circuit]"" ''Killer List of Videogames''. URL Accessed on [[November 19]], [[2006]].</ref>  Players must progress through a number of levels made up of horizontally scrolling screens filled with enemy characters that must be defeated using a combination of attacks and movement abilities each character utilizes.  Every character is given a selection of these abilities that can be expanded as game play progress by purchasing special ""upgrade discs"" after the completion of each level using coins obtained by defeating enemies.  These techniques are often a combination of either of the two action buttons and the [[joystick]], and can add additional varieties to a given character's arsenal.  A player must attack enemies until their health (indicated by a bar under the player's when the enemy is attacked) is reduced to 0 and they are thus knocked out.  If a player's health bar is depleted, they will also become knocked out and must use up one life to continue.  If all of a player's lives are depleted in this fashion, the game will end unless more credits are purchased.

Special techniques called ""Battle Downloads"" can be used by pressing both action buttons while jumping, which results in the player and his allies (if any are present) gaining a certain attribute, the effect of which is unique to each character.  Cyber Blue, for example, can use his Battle Download ""Power Up"" to increase the amount of damage dealt by attacks, while Yellow Iris' ""Speed Up"" increases attack speed.  A character will start with a stock of two of these techniques to use per life, and can obtain more from capsules scattered throughout the levels, up to a maximum of five.

Various items can be found inside destructible objects such as barrels and crates, and can provide the player with additional health or add points to their total score.  Once a player's score reaches a set amount, they are rewarded with an extra life that will give them another chance to continue from where they were knocked out by an enemy.

==Story==
Taking place in the future year [[21st century|20XX]], ''Battle Circuit'' follows the exploits of a group of super-powered bounty hunters as they apprehend wanted criminals (identified by special serial numbers) in the city of Neo Koba.  The game begins with player attempting to apprehend criminal 9696X, a scientist named Doctor Saturn and his [[blob]]-like [[sidekick]] aboard his [[spaceship]] orbiting Earth.  After the battle, the character selected by the player returns to his employer, Harry, and is promptly given another assignment to capture the leader of the ""Delete Gang"", Johnny, who holds a valuable [[floppy disc]] in his possession.  The bounty hunter then confronts Johnny at his [[disco]] hideout and learns that the disc contains a malicious [[computer program]] known as the ""Shiva System"", which is capable of control all the computerized systems in the world.  As one of the characters chosen, player's must travel through various levels and fight through various members of the Delete Gang to obtain the disc and claim their bounty.<ref name=script> In-game script for ''Battle Circuit'', English-language version. 1997</ref>

==Characters==
''Battle Circuit'' contains five possible characters for the player to choose from, each with their own unique attacks and Battle Download ability.  Though each of the character's real names are mentioned in their individual character profiles during the opening demo, they are mostly referred to by their codenames, each indicating a physical attribute and corresponding color. 
* Brian Bruno ""'''Cyber Blue'''"": A seasoned bounty hunter with several [[cyborg|cybernetic]] attachments to his body, giving him the ability to discharge electricity and project energy from his fists.
* Andrey Mishucin ""'''Captain Silver'''"": A highly-accomplished bounty hunter who can stretch and shape his body at will.  His powers give him the ability to project ice particles from his body, as well as create a number of objects from his suit.  Because of the vast nature of his powers, they will threaten to overwhelm him if he should ever lose concentration.<ref name=script> In-game script for ''Battle Circuit'', English-language version. 1997</ref>
* Diana Martines ""'''Yellow Iris'''"" (Called ""'''Yellow Beast'''"" in the original [[Japanese language|Japanese]] version): A part-time [[fashion model]] whose feral appearance gives her access to a number of clawing and agility-based techniques.  She is also skilled with a [[whip]] and is accompanied by her pet [[fox]] ""Fin"".<ref name=script> In-game script for ''Battle Circuit'', English-language version. 1997</ref>
* Pinky ""'''Pink Ostrich'''"": A large, sentient, pink [[ostrich]] with an [[eye patch]] and jewel [[necklace]] who is always accompanied by her owner, a young girl named Pola.  Purported, she is the ""only ostrich in the world who can fly"",<ref name=script> In-game script for ''Battle Circuit'', English-language version. 1997</ref> and attacks with an assortment of aerial and spinning techniques.
* Unknown ""'''Alien Green'''"": An [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] creature of unknown origin who resembles a large [[venus flytrap]] with leg-like roots and a large [[eye]] in its abdomen.  Its attacks mostly center around its vine-like arms, which it can quickly swing to create whirlwinds, as well as grab opponents and slam them against the ground.

==Music==
''Battle Circuit'''s background music was composed by Syun Nishigaki of Capcom Arcade Sound Team, and has a recurring [[pop music|pop]] and [[electronic music|electronic]] theme present throughout the game.  The music was recorded using only synth-based computer generated sound, a common recording medium for arcade games on the [[CPS-2]].  An official soundtrack entitled ''Battle Circuit Original Soundtrack'' (catalog number VICL-60056) was released commercially in Japan by [[Victor Entertainment]] on [[July 2]], 1997 and retailed for [[Japanese yen|¥]]2,205.<ref name=soundtrack> ""[http://www.gmronline.com/info.asp?CatNumber=VICL-60056 Battle Circuit Original Soundtrack]"" ''Game Music Revolution''.

'''Bad Blood (2004)''' was a [[professional wrestling]] [[pay-per-view]] event produced by [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE), which took place on June 13, 2004 at the [[Nationwide Arena]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. It was the third and final annual [[WWE Bad Blood|Bad Blood]] event. Seven professional wrestling matches, [[mock combat|performances]] with pre-determined outcomes between wrestlers with fictional personalities that are portrayed as real, were featured on the event's [[card (sports)|card]]. The buildup to the matches and the scenarios that took place before, during, and after the event were planned by WWE's [[List of World Wrestling Entertainment employees#Creative writers|script writers]]. The event starred [[List of World Wrestling Entertainment employees|wrestlers]] from the [[WWE Raw|Raw]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]]: a storyline expansion of the promotion where employees are assigned to a wrestling brand under the WWE banner.

The [[main event]] was a [[Hell in a Cell]] match, a match where wrestlers fight in a ring surrounded by a steel structure of metal, featuring wrestlers fighting in a ring surrounded by a steel structure of metal. Triple H ([[Triple H|Paul Levesque]]) defeated Shawn Michaels ([[Shawn Michaels|Michael Hickenbottom]]) by pinfall after two consecutive [[Facebuster#Double underhook facebuster|Pedigrees]]. Two featured bouts were featured on the [[undercard]]. In respective [[Professional wrestling match types#Variations of singles matches|standard wrestling matches]],  [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Chris Benoit]] defeated Kane ([[Glen Jacobs]]) to retain his championship and [[Randy Orton]] defeated [[Shelton Benjamin]] to retain the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]].

Including the scripted buildup, Bad Blood (2004) grossed over [[United States dollar|$]]494,000 ticket sales from an attendance of 9,000. When the event was released on [[DVD]], it reached a peak position of third on ''[[Billboard]]'s'' DVD Sales Chart.

36,start,Skewball,roots music/article scope,"'''Skewball''' was the name of a British [[racehorse]], most famous as the subject of a [[ballad]]. The horse was born in 1741, and originally owned by Francis, 2nd [[Earl of Godolphin]], and later sold. His name has been recorded as ""Squball"", ""Sku-ball"", or ""'''Stewball'''"". He won many races in England, and a famous one in Ireland, which is generally the subject of the song of the same name. Popular legend has Skewball belonging to an Arthur Marvell. Based on the horse's name, Skewball was likely a [[skewbald]] horse, though there is speculation that he was a [[Bay (color)|bay]]. 

==Songs==
There are two major different versions of the [[Sporting song|sporting ballad]], generally titled either ""Skewball"" or ""Stewball""; the latter is more popular in America.  There are multiple variations within the two major divisions.  Versions date at least as far back as the 18th century, appearing on numerous [[broadside (music)|broadsides]].  In both songs the title horse is the underdog in the race, up against a favored grey mare (usually called either ""Griselda"" or ""Molly""), and although in most versions of Stewball the winning horse triumphs due to the stumbling of the lead horse, Skewball wins simply by being the faster horse in the end.  Probably the most significant lyrical difference in the songs is the conversation Skewball has with his jockey, while Stewball behaves more like a typical horse and does not speak. 

American versions were sung and adapted by slaves in the Southern United States, and have Stewball racing in [[California]], [[Texas]], and [[Kentucky]].  British versions, when the setting is mentioned, often place the race in [[Kildare]], [[Ireland]], leading some to believe that the song is actually Irish in origin.  The fact that these accounts still imply that the horse's nationality was English, and they celebrate a victory over a horse that is presumably Irish, makes it likely the song is originally English, and its setting in Ireland is due to it being the site of Skewball's most famous race.

==Recordings==

""...comes aprancin' and adancin' my darling Stewball.""

A notable recording is by American folk legend [[Woody Guthrie]], who included an English and an American interpretation (both entitled Stewball) on tape and recorded in Volume 4 of [[The Asch Recordings]] ([[1930]]-[[1940]]).  The American interpretation is sung with an African American '[[call and response (music)|call and response]]' style while the English interpretation has a more traditional folk style. The American interpretation has Stewball as being born in California with the famed race against the grey mare taking place in [[Dallas, Texas]].  This version of the song was popularized by Texas singer/songwriter [[Robert Earl Keen]], in [[The Live Album]] performance at Dallas's [[Sons of Hermann Hall]].

Another notable version of ""Stewball"" was recorded by [[John Herald]] and the [[Greenbriar Boys]], and popularized by [[Peter, Paul and Mary]]. [[The Weavers]] and [[Lonnie Donegan]] recorded it in the 1950s. Other versions include [[Joan Baez]]' on ''[[Joan Baez/5]]'' (1964) and [[The Hollies]] on [[Would You Believe]] (1966). The 1971 [[John Lennon]] song ""[[Happy Xmas (War Is Over)]]"" has a similar meter and tune [http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/VOLUME01/Baroque_Folk_Lennon.html]. Popular British versions include recordings by [[A. L. Lloyd]], [[Martin Carthy]], and [[Steeleye Span]] on the album ''[[Ten Man Mop, or Mr. Reservoir Butler Rides Again]]''.  An American version following the British tradition is recorded by [[Broadside Electric]] on [[Black-edged Visiting Card]].  

Additionally, a [[French language|French]] cover has been recorded by [[Hugues Aufray]], becoming one of Aufray's biggest hits. However, this version is unlike the English versions. Aufray's version of the song takes the perspective of a man recalling an experience as a ten-year old boy. His father believes that Stewball will win a race, so he puts all his money and assets into this venture. Toward the end of the race, Stewball tragically falls. The veterinarian finishes him off with a single shot.  This is the first time that the narrator witnesses his father cry.
Aufray's version is very different from other interpretations in that it features Stewball not winning his race and dying due to an injury.

In ''[[The System of Nature]]'' (1770), he describes the universe in terms of philosophical [[materialism]], strict [[determinism]], and atheism. This and his ''Good Sense'' (1772) were condemned by the [[Parlement|Parlement of Paris]], and copies of the books were publicly burned.]]

Others argue for atheism on philosophical, social or historical grounds.

The term ''atheism'' originated as a [[pejorative]] [[epithet]] applied to any person or belief in conflict with established religion.<ref name=drachmann>{{cite book | last = Drachmann | first = A. B. | title = Atheism in Pagan Antiquity | publisher = Chicago: Ares Publishers | year = 1977 (""an unchanged reprint of the 1922 edition"") | id = ISBN 0-89005-201-8 | quote = Atheism and atheist are words formed from Greek roots and with Greek derivative endings. Nevertheless they are not Greek; their formation is not consonant with Greek usage. In Greek they said ''{{transl|grc|atheos}}'' and ''{{transl|grc|atheotēs}}''; to these the English words ungodly and ungodliness correspond rather closely. In exactly the same way as ungodly, ''{{transl|grc|atheos}}'' was used as an expression of severe censure and moral condemnation; this use is an old one, and the oldest that can be traced. Not till later do we find it employed to denote a certain philosophical creed. }}</ref> With the spread of [[freethought]], [[scientific skepticism]], and [[criticism of religion]], the term began to gather a more specific meaning and was sometimes used as a self-description by atheists.

==Etymology==
[[Image:Ephesians 2,12 - Greek atheos.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Greek word {{lang|grc|αθεοι}} (''atheoi''), as it appears in the [[Epistle to the Ephesians]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Ephesians|2:12}}) on the early 3rd-century [[Papyrus 46]]. It is usually translated into English as ""[those who are] without God"".<ref>The word {{lang|grc|αθεοι}}—in any of its forms—appears nowhere else in the [[Septuagint]] or the [[New Testament]]. {{cite book |last=Robertson |first=A.T. |title=Word Pictures in the New Testament |origyear=1932 |accessdate=2007-04-12 |date=1960 |publisher=Broadman Press |chapter=Ephesians: Chapter 2 |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/r/robertson_at/wordpictures/htm/EPH2.RWP.html |quote=Old Greek word, not in LXX, only here in N.T. Atheists in the original sense of being without God and also in the sense of hostility to God from failure to worship him. See Paul's words in Ro 1:18–32.}}</ref>]]

In early [[Ancient Greek]], the adjective ''{{transl|grc|atheos}}'' ({{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἄθεος|ἄθεος]]}}, from the [[privative a|privative {{lang|grc|ἀ}}-]] + {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:θεός|θεός]]}} ""god"") meant ""godless"". The word began to indicate more-intentional, active godlessness in the [[5th century BCE]], acquiring definitions of ""severing relations with the gods"" or ""denying the gods, ungodly"" instead of the earlier meaning of [[:wikt:ἀσεβής|ἀσεβής]] (''{{transl|grc|asebēs}}'') or ""impious"". Modern translations of classical texts sometimes render ''{{transl|grc|atheos}}'' as ""atheistic"". As an abstract noun, there was also {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἀθεότης|ἀθεότης]]}} (''{{transl|grc|atheotēs}}''), ""atheism"". [[Cicero]] transliterated the Greek word into the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|[[:wikt:atheos#Latin|atheos]]}}''. The term found frequent use in the debate between [[early Christianity|early Christians]] and pagans, with each side attributing it, in the pejorative sense, to the other.<ref name=drachmann/>

In [[English language|English]], the term ''atheism'' was derived from the [[French language|French]] ''{{lang|fr|[[wikt:athéisme|athéisme]]}}'' in about 1587.<ref>Rendered as ''Athisme'': {{cite book | last = Golding | first = Arthur | coauthors = [[Philip Sidney]] | authorlink = Arthur Golding | title =  [[Philippe de Mornay|Mornay's]] Woorke concerning the Trewnesse of the Christian Religion, written in French; Against Atheists, Epicures, Paynims, Iewes, Mahumetists, and other infidels | publisher = London | year = 1587 |pages= xx. 310 |quote= Athisme, that is to say, vtter godlesnes. }} Translation of ''De la verite de la religion chrestienne'' (1581). </ref> The term ''atheist'' (from Fr.

A clear distinction is rarely drawn in modern writings between these two definitions, but some archaic uses of ''atheism'' encompassed only disbelief in the singular God, not in [[polytheism|polytheistic]] deities. It is on this basis that the obsolete term ''[[adevism]]'' was coined in the late 19th century to describe an absence of belief in plural deities. {{cite journal | author = Britannica | title = Atheonism | journal = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | edition = 11th Edition | year = 1911}}</ref> In the 20th century, [[globalization]] contributed to the expansion of the term to refer to disbelief in all deities, though it remains common in Western society to describe atheism as simply ""disbelief in God.""<ref name=""martin"">Martin, Michael.

==Definitions and distinctions==
[[Image:AtheismImplicitExplicit3.svg|thumb|right|230px|A chart showing the relationship between the definitions of weak/strong and implicit/explicit atheism. An implicit atheist has not thought about belief in gods; such an individual would be described as implicitly without a belief in gods. An explicit atheist has made an assertion regarding belief in gods; such an individual may eschew belief in gods (weak atheism), or affirm that gods do not exist (strong atheism).]]
Writers have disagreed on how best to define and classify ''atheism'',<ref name=""eb911-atheism"">{{cite web | date = 1911 | url = http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Atheism | title = ""Atheism"" | work = Encyclopedia Britannica | accessdate = 2007-06-07}}</ref> contesting what supernatural entities it applies to, whether it is an assertion in its own right or merely the absence of one, and whether it requires a conscious, explicit rejection. A variety of categories have been proposed to try to distinguish the different forms of atheism, most of which treat atheism as ""absence of belief in deities"" in order to explore the varieties of this nontheism.

===Range===
Part of the ambiguity and controversy involved in defining ''atheism'' arises from the similar ambiguity and controversy in defining words like ''deity'' and ''God''. The plurality of wildly different [[conceptions of God]] and deities leads to differing ideas regarding atheism's applicability. In contexts where ''[[theism]]'' is defined as the belief in a [[monotheism|singular]] [[personal God]], for example, people who believe in a variety of other deities may be classified as atheists, including [[deism|deists]] and even [[polytheism|polytheists]]. In the 20th century, this view has fallen into disfavor as ''theism'' has come to be understood as encompassing belief in any divinity.<ref name=""mmartin"">Martin, Michael. ''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521842700 The Cambridge Companion to Atheism]''. Cambridge University
Press. 2006. ISBN 0521842700.</ref>

With respect to the range of phenomena being rejected, atheism may counter anything from the existence of a god, to the existence of any spiritual, [[supernatural]], or [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] concepts, such as those of Hinduism and Buddhism.<ref name=""Britannica1992"">{{cite journal | author = Britannica | title = Atheism as rejection of religious beliefs | url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-38265/atheism | accessdate = 2006-10-27 | journal = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | edition = 15th Edition | volume = 1 | pages = 666 | year = 1992 | id = 0852294735}}</ref>

===Implicit vs. explicit===
{{main|Implicit and explicit atheism}}
Definitions of atheism also vary in the degree of consideration a person must put to the idea of gods to be considered an atheist. Minimally, atheism may be seen as the absence of belief in one or more gods. It has been contended that this broad definition includes newborns and other people who have not been exposed to theistic ideas. As far back as 1772, [[d'Holbach]] said that ""All children are born Atheists; they have no idea of God"".<ref>{{cite book | last = d'Holbach | first = P. H. T. | authorlink = Baron d'Holbach | title = Good Sense | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/7319 | accessdate = 2006-10-27 | year = 1772}}</ref> [[George H. Smith]] (1979) suggested that: ""The man who is unacquainted with theism is an atheist because he does not believe in a god. This category would also include the child with the conceptual capacity to grasp the issues involved, but who is still unaware of those issues. The fact that this child does not believe in god qualifies him as an atheist.""<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1979|p=14}}.</ref> Smith coined the term ''implicit atheism'' to refer to ""the absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it"" and ''explicit atheism'' to refer to the more common definition of conscious disbelief.

The view that children are born atheist is relatively recent. Prior to the 18th century, the existence of God was so universally accepted in the western world that even the possibility of true atheism was questioned. This is called ''theistic [[innatism]]''—the notion that all people believe in God from birth; within this view was the connotation that atheists are simply in denial.<ref>{{cite book | last = Cudworth | first = Ralph | authorlink = Ralph Cudworth | title = The True Intellectual System of the Universe: the first part, wherein all the reason and philosophy of atheism is confuted and its impossibility demonstrated | year = 1678}}</ref> It is also asserted that atheists are quick to believe in God in times of crisis—that atheists make [[deathbed conversion]]s, or that ""there are no [[atheists in foxholes]].""

The broadest demarcation with respect to atheistic rationale is between practical and theoretical atheism. The different forms of theoretical atheism each derive from a particular rationale or philosophical argument. In contrast, practical atheism requires no specific argument, and can include indifference to and ignorance of the idea of gods.

===Practical atheism===
In ''practical'', or ''[[pragmatism|pragmatic]]'', atheism, also known as [[apatheism]], individuals live as if there are no gods and explain natural phenomena without resorting to the divine. The existence of gods is not denied, but may be designated unnecessary or useless; gods neither provide purpose to life, nor influence everyday life, according to this view.<ref>{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=20}}.</ref> A form of practical atheism with implications for the [[scientific community]] is [[methodological naturalism]]—the ""tacit adoption or assumption of philosophical naturalism within [[scientific method]] with or without fully accepting or believing it.""<ref name=""neps"">Schafersman, Steven D.

Department of Philosophy, The University of Texas. February 1997. Revised May 2007. Retrieved on [[2007-04-09]].</ref>

Practical atheism can take various forms: 
*Absence of religious motivation—belief in gods does not motivate moral action, religious action, or any other form of action;
*Active exclusion of the problem of gods and religion from intellectual pursuit and practical action;
*Indifference—the absence of any interest in the problems of gods and religion; or
*Ignorance—lacking any idea of gods.<ref>{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=21}}.</ref>

Historically, practical atheism has been associated with moral failure, willful ignorance and impiety. Those considered practical atheists were said to behave as though God, ethics and social responsibility did not exist; they abandoned duty and embraced [[hedonism]]. According to the French Catholic philosopher Étienne Borne, ""Practical atheism is not the denial of the existence of God, but complete godlessness of action; it is a moral evil, implying not the denial of the absolute validity of the moral law but simply rebellion against that law.""<ref>{{cite book | last = Borne | first = Étienne
 | title = Atheism | year = 1961 | publisher = New York: Hawthorn Books | id = ISBN 0-415-04727-7}}</ref>

===Theoretical atheism===
{{Further|[[Existence of God]]}}

Theoretical, or contemplative, atheism explicitly posits arguments against the existence of gods, responding to common [[existence of God#Arguments for the existence of God|theistic arguments]] such as the [[argument from design]] or [[Pascal's Wager]]. The theoretical reasons for rejecting gods assume various psychological, sociological, metaphysical, and epistemological forms. 

====Epistemological arguments====
{{Further|[[Agnostic atheism]], [[Theological noncognitivism]]}}
Epistemological atheism argues that people cannot know God or determine the existence of God. The foundation of epistemological atheism is [[agnosticism]], which takes a variety of forms. In the philosophy of [[immanence]], divinity is inseparable from the world itself, including a person's mind, and each person's [[consciousness]] is locked in the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]].  According to this form of agnosticism, this limitation in perspective prevents any objective inference from belief in a god to assertions of its existence. The [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] agnosticism of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] only accepts knowledge deduced with human rationality; this form of atheism holds that gods are not discernible as a matter of principle, and therefore cannot be known to exist. [[Philosophical skepticism|Skepticism]], based on the ideas of [[David Hume|Hume]], asserts that certainty about anything is impossible, so one can never know the existence of God. The allocation of agnosticism to atheism is disputed; it can also be regarded as an independent, basic world-view.<ref>{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=20}}.</ref>

Other forms of atheistic argumentation that may qualify as epistemological, including [[logical positivism]] and [[ignosticism]], assert the meaninglessness or unintelligibility of basic terms such as ""God"" and statements such as ""God is all-powerful"". [[Theological noncognitivism]] holds that the statement ""God exists"" does not express a proposition, but is nonsensical or cognitively meaningless. It has been argued both ways as to whether such individuals classify into some form of atheism or agnosticism. Philosophers [[Alfred Ayer|A. J. Ayer]] and [[Theodore M. Drange]] reject both categories, stating that both camps accept ""God exists"" as a proposition; they instead place noncognitivism in its own category.<ref>[[Theodore Drange|Drange, Theodore M.]] (1998). ""[http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/definition.html Atheism, Agnosticism, Noncognitivism]"". [[Internet Infidels]], ''Secular Web Library''. Retrieved on [[2007-04-07]].</ref><ref>[[Alfred Ayer|Ayer, A. J.]] (1946). ''Language, Truth and Logic''. Dover. pp. 115–116. In a footnote, Ayer attributes this view to ""Professor H. H. Price"".</ref>

====Metaphysical arguments====
{{Further|[[Monism]], [[Physicalism]]}}
Metaphysical atheism is based on metaphysical [[monism]]—the view that reality is homogeneous and indivisible. Absolute metaphysical atheists subscribe to some form of [[physicalism]], hence they explicitly deny the existence of non-physical beings. Relative metaphysical atheists maintain an implicit denial of a particular concept of God based on the incongruity between their individual philosophies and attributes commonly applied to God, such as [[transcendence]], a [[Personal God|personal aspect]], or unity. Examples of relative metaphysical atheism include [[pantheism]], [[panentheism]], and [[deism]].<ref>{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=19}}.</ref>

[[Image:Epicurus bust.jpg|thumb|left|[[Epicurus]] is credited with first expounding the [[problem of evil]]. [[David Hume]] in his ''[[Dialogues concerning Natural Religion]]'' (1779) cited Epicurus in stating the argument as a series of questions:<br/><br/>""Is [God] willing to prevent evil, but not able? then is he impotent. Is he able, but not willing? then is he
malevolent. Is he both able and willing? whence then is evil?""]]

====Psychological, sociological and economical arguments====

{{Further|[[Psychology of religion]], [[Neurotheology]]}}
Philosophers such as [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]] and [[Sigmund Freud]] argued that God and other religious beliefs are human inventions, created to fulfill various psychological and emotional wants or needs. This is also the Buddhist view.<ref>Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught.'' Grove Press, 1974. Pages 51–52.</ref> [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], influenced by the work of Feuerbach, argued that belief in God and religion are social functions, used by those in power to oppress the working class. According to [[Mikhail Bakunin]], ""the idea of God implies the abdication of human reason and justice; it is the most decisive negation of human liberty, and necessarily ends in the enslavement of mankind, in theory and practice."" He reversed [[Voltaire]]'s famous aphorism that if God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent Him, writing instead that ""if God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish Him.""<ref>[[Michael Bakunin|Bakunin, Michael]] (1916).

====Logical and evidential arguments====
{{further|[[Existence of God#Deductive arguments (against)|Deductive arguments against the existence of God]], [[Problem of evil]], [[Argument from nonbelief|Divine hiddenness]]}}
Logical atheism holds that the various [[conceptions of God|conceptions of gods]], such as the [[personal God]] of Christianity, are ascribed logically inconsistent qualities. Such atheists present [[existence of God#Deductive arguments (against)|deductive arguments]] against the existence of God, which assert the incompatibility between certain traits, such as perfection, creator-status, [[immutability]], [[omniscience]], [[omnipresence]], [[omnibenevolence]], [[transcendence]], personhood (a personal being), nonphysicality, [[justice]] and [[mercy]].<ref>Various authors.

====Anthropocentric arguments====
{{Further|[[Philosophical anthropology]], [[Humanism (life stance)|Humanism]]}}
[[Axiological]], or constructive, atheism rejects the existence of gods in favor of a ""higher absolute,"" such as [[Human nature|humanity]].<!-- The previous wikilink is a disambig. page. Someone redirect it to human race, human nature, etc., etc. --> This form of atheism favors humanity as the absolute source of ethics and values, and permits individuals to resolve moral problems without resorting to God.

==History==
{{main|History of atheism}}

Although the term ''atheism'' originated in 16th-century [[France]], ideas that would be recognized today as atheistic are documented from [[classical antiquity]] and the [[Vedic period]].

===Early Indic religion===
{{main|Atheism in Hinduism}}
[[Atheism in Hinduism|Atheistic schools]] are found in [[Hinduism]], which is otherwise a very theistic religion. The thoroughly materialistic and anti-religious philosophical [[Carvaka]] School that originated in [[India]] around [[6th century BCE]] is probably the most explicitly atheistic school of philosophy in India. This branch of Indian philosophy is classified as a [[nastika|heterodox]] system and is not considered part of the six orthodox schools of Hinduism, but it is noteworthy as evidence of a materialistic movement within Hinduism.<ref>Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles A. Moore. ''A Sourcebook in Indian Philosophy''. (Princeton University Press: 1957, Twelfth Princeton Paperback printing 1989) pp. 227–249. ISBN 0-691-01958-4.</ref> Chatterjee and Datta explain that our understanding of Carvaka philosophy is fragmentary, based largely on criticism of the ideas by other schools, and that it is not a living tradition:

<blockquote>
""Though materialism in some form or other has always been present in India, and occasional references are found in the Vedas, the Buddhistic literature, the Epics, as well as in the later philosophical works we do not find any systematic work on materialism, nor any organised school of followers as the other philosophical schools possess.  But almost every work of the other schools states, for reputation, the materialistic views.  Our knowledge of Indian materialism is chiefly based on these.""<ref>Satischandra Chatterjee and Dhirendramohan Datta. ''An Introduction to Indian Philosophy''. Eighth Reprint Edition. (University of Calcutta: 1984). p. 55.</ref>
</blockquote>

Other Indian philosophies generally regarded as atheistic include [[Samkhya|Classical Samkhya]] and [[Mimamsa|Purva Mimamsa]]. The rejection of a personal creator God is also seen in [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]] in India.<ref name=""Joshi"">{{cite journal |last=Joshi |first=L.R. |year=1966 |title= A New Interpretation of Indian Atheism |journal=Philosophy East and West |volume=16 |issue=3/4 |pages=189–206 |url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0031-8221(196607%2F10)16%3A3%2F4%3C189%3AANIOIA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-S }}</ref>

===Classical antiquity===
[[Image:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|right|In [[Plato|Plato's]] ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'', [[Socrates]] (pictured) was accused by [[Meletus]] of not believing in gods at all.]]
Western atheism has its roots in [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] [[Greek philosophy]], but did not emerge as a distinct world-view until the late [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].<ref>{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|pp=73–74}}.

Another atomic materialist, [[Epicurus]], disputed many religious doctrines, including the existence of an [[afterlife]] or a [[personal God|personal deity]]; he considered the [[soul]] purely material and mortal. While [[Epicureanism]] did not rule out the existence of gods, he believed that if they did exist, they were unconcerned with humanity.<ref name=""BBC"">{{cite web | author=BBC |authorlink = BBC |title = Ethics and Religion—Atheism | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/atheism/ | accessdate = 2007-04-12 | publisher = [[bbc.co.uk]]}}</ref> 

The Roman poet [[Lucretius]] agreed that, if there were gods, they were unconcerned with humanity and unable to affect the natural world. For this reason, he believed humanity should have no fear of the supernatural. In ''[[De rerum natura]]'' (""On the nature of things""), he expounds his Epicurean views of the cosmos, atoms, the soul, mortality, and religion.<ref>{{gutenberg|no=785|name=On the Nature of Things by Lucretius}} Book I, ""Substance is Eternal"".

The Roman philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]] held that one should suspend judgment about virtually all beliefs—a form of skepticism known as [[Pyrrhonism]]—that nothing was inherently evil, and that [[ataraxia]] (""peace of mind"") is attainable by withholding one's judgment. His relatively large volume of surviving works had a lasting influence on later philosophers.<ref name=""gordonstein"">Stein, Gordon (Ed.) (1980).

===Early Middle Ages to the Renaissance===



The espousal of atheistic views was rare in Europe during the [[Early Middle Ages]] and [[Middle Ages]] (see [[Medieval Inquisition]]); metaphysics, religion and theology were the dominant interests.<ref>{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=4}}</ref> There were, however, movements within this period that forwarded heterodox conceptions of the Christian God, including differing views of the nature, transcendence, and knowability of God. Individuals and groups such as [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]], [[David of Dinant]], [[Amalric of Bena]], and the [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]] maintained Christian viewpoints with [[pantheism|pantheistic]] tendencies. [[Nicholas of Cusa]] held to a form of [[fideism]] he called ''[[De Docta Ignorantia|docta ignorantia]]'' (""learned ignorance""), asserting that God is beyond human categorization, and our knowledge of God is limited to conjecture. [[William of Ockham]] inspired anti-metaphysical tendencies with his [[nominalism|nominalistic]] limitation of human knowledge to singular objects, and asserted that the divine [[essence]] could not be intuitively or rationally apprehended by human intellect. Followers of Ockham, such as [[John of Mirecourt]] and [[Nicholas of Autrecourt]] furthered this view. The resulting division between faith and reason influenced later theologians such as [[John Wycliffe]], [[Jan Hus]], and [[Martin Luther]].<ref>{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=4}}.</ref>

The [[Renaissance]] did much to expand the scope of freethought and skeptical inquiry. Individuals such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] sought experimentation as a means of explanation, and opposed [[Appeal to authority|arguments from religious authority]]. Other critics of religion and the Church during this time included [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Bonaventure des Périers]], and [[François Rabelais]].<ref name=""gordonstein""/>

===Early Modern Period===
The [[Renaissance]] and [[Reformation]] eras witnessed a resurgence in religious fervor, as evidenced by the proliferation of new religious orders, confraternities, and popular devotions in the Catholic world, and the appearance of increasingly austere Protestant sects such as the [[Calvinists]].  This era of interconfessional rivalry permitted an even wider scope of theological and philosophical speculation, much of which would later be used to advance a religiously skeptical world-view.

[[Criticism of Christianity]] became increasingly frequent in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and England, where there appears to have been a religious malaise, according to contemporary sources.  Some Protestant thinkers, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], espoused a materialist philosophy and skepticism toward supernatural occurrences. In the late 17th century, [[Deism]] came to be openly espoused by intellectuals such as [[John Toland (Irish Philosopher)|John Toland]], and practically all the ''[[philosophe]]s'' of 18th-century France and England held to some form of Deism. Despite their ridicule of Christianity, many Deists held atheism in scorn. The first openly atheistic thinkers, such as [[Baron d'Holbach]], appeared in the late 18th century, when expressing disbelief in God became a less dangerous position.<ref>{{cite book | last = d'Holbach | first = P. H. T. | authorlink = Baron d'Holbach | title = The system of nature | url = http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~freethought/holbach/system/0syscontents.htm | accessdate = 2006-10-27 | year = 1770}}</ref> [[David Hume]] was the most systematic exponent of Enlightenment thought, developing a skeptical epistemology grounded in empiricism, undermining the metaphysical basis of natural theology.

[[Image:Feuerbach Ludwig.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]]'s ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1841) would greatly influence philosophers such as [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[David Strauss]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]. He considered God to be a human invention and religious activities to be wish-fulfillment.]]

The [[French Revolution]] took atheism outside the salons and into the public sphere. Attempts to enforce the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] led to anti-clerical violence and the expulsion of many clergy from France.  The chaotic political events in revolutionary Paris eventually enabled the more radical [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]] to seize power in 1793, ushering in the [[Reign of Terror]].  At its climax, the more militant atheists attempted to forcibly de-Christianize France, replacing religion with a [[Cult of Reason]].  These persecutions ended with the [[Thermidorian Reaction]], but some of the secularizing measures of this period remained a permanent legacy of French politics.

The [[Napoleonic era]] institutionalized the secularization of French society, and exported the revolution to northern Italy, in the hopes of creating pliable republics.  In the nineteenth century, many atheists and other anti-religious thinkers devoted their efforts to political and social revolution, facilitating the [[Revolutions of 1848|upheavals of 1848]], the [[Italian unification|Risorgimento]] in Italy, and the growth of an international [[socialism|socialist]] movement. 

In the latter half of the 19th century, atheism rose to prominence under the influence of [[rationalism|rationalistic]] and [[freethought|freethinking]] philosophers. Many prominent German philosophers of this era denied the existence of deities and were critical of religion, including [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Karl Marx]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=BKz2FcDrFy0C&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=nietzsche+schopenhauer+marx+feuerbach&ots=Uj5_B0kDbS&sig=1lXbokGVRbwxqAIbmcOwL033N88 |title=Subjectivity and Irreligion: Atheism and Agnosticism in Kant, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |accessdate=2007-04-12 |last=Ray |first=Matthew Alun |date=[[2003]]}}</ref>

===The 20th Century===
Atheism in the 20th century, particularly in the form of practical atheism, advanced in many societies. Atheistic thought found recognition in a wide variety of other, broader philosophies, such as [[existentialism]], [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], [[secular humanism]], [[nihilism]], [[logical positivism]], [[Marxism]], [[feminism]],<ref>Overall, Christine. ""Feminism and Atheism,"" in {{harvnb|Martin|2007|pp=233–246}}.</ref> and the general scientific and [[rationalist movement]].

Logical positivism and [[scientism]] paved the way for [[neopositivism]], [[analytical philosophy]], [[structuralism]], and [[naturalism]]. Neopositivism and analytical philosophy discarded classical rationalism and metaphysics in favor of strict empiricism and epistemological [[nominalism]]. Proponents such as [[Bertrand Russell]] emphatically rejected the existence of God. In his early work, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] attempted to separate metaphysical and supernatural language from rational discourse. [[A. J. Ayer]] asserted the unverifiability and meaninglessness of religious statements, citing his adherence to the empirical sciences. Relatedly the applied [[structuralism]] of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]] sourced religious language to the human subconscious in denying its transcendental meaning. [[John Niemeyer Findlay|J. N. Findlay]] and [[J. J. C. Smart]] argued that the existence of God is not logically necessary. Naturalists and materialistic monists such as [[John Dewey]] considered the natural world to be the basis of everything, denying the existence of God or immortality.<ref>{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=16}}.</ref><ref name=""stanford""/>

The 20th century also saw the political advancement of atheism, spurred on by interpretation of the works of [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]]. After the 1917 revolution in Russia, increased religious freedom for minority religions lasted for a few years, before the policies of Stalinism turned towards repression of religion. The [[Soviet Union]] and other [[communist state]]s promoted [[state atheism]] and opposed religion, often by violent means.<ref>{{cite book| last=Solzhenitsyn |first= Aleksandr I.| title=The Gulag Archipelago| publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics|id=ISBN 0-06-000776-1}}</ref><!--

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of atheism}}

It is difficult to quantify the number of atheists in the world. Respondents to religious-belief polls may define ""atheism"" differently or draw different distinctions between ''atheism'', non-religious beliefs, and non-theistic religious and spiritual beliefs. In addition, people in some regions of the world refrain from reporting themselves as atheists to avoid social stigma, [[Discrimination of atheists|discrimination]], and [[persecution of atheists|persecution]]. A 2005 survey published in ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' found that the non-religious make up about 11.9% of the world's population, and atheists about 2.3%. This figure does not include those who follow atheistic religions, such as some Buddhists.<ref name=""Britannica demographics"">{{cite web

It found that  Americans are more likely than Europeans to believe in any form of God or Supreme Being (73%). Of the European adults surveyed, Italians are the most likely to express this belief (62%) and the French the least likely (27%). In France, 32% declared themselves atheists, and an additional 32% declared themselves [[agnostic]].<ref>{{cite web

A letter published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1998 reported a survey suggesting that belief in a personal God or [[afterlife]] was at an all-time low among the members of the U.S. [[National Academy of Science]], only 7.0% of whom believed in a personal God as compared to more than 85% of the general U.S. population.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Correspondence: Leading scientists still reject God |last=Larson |first=Edward J. |coauthors=Larry Witham |year=1998 |journal=Nature |volume=394 |issue= 6691 |pages=313}} Available at [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/news/file002.html StephenJayGould.org], Stephen Jay Gould archive.

Such an inverse [[correlation]] between [[religiosity and intelligence]] has been found by 39 studies carried out between 1927 and 2002, according to an article in ''Mensa Magazine''.<ref>According to Dawkins (2006), p. 103. Dawkins cites Bell, Paul. ""Would you believe it?"" ''Mensa Magazine'', UK Edition, Feb. 2002, pp. 12–13. Analyzing 43 studies carried out since 1927, Bell found that all but four reported such a connection, and he concluded that ""the higher one's intelligence or education level, the less one is likely to be religious or hold 'beliefs' of any kind.""</ref> These findings broadly concur with a 1958 statistical [[meta-analysis]] from Professor [[Michael Argyle (psychologist)|Michael Argyle]] of [[Oxford University]]. He analyzed seven research studies that had investigated correlation between attitude to religion and [[Intelligence quotient|measured intelligence]] among school and college students from the U.S. Although a clear negative correlation was found, the analysis did not identify causality but noted that factors such as authoritarian family background and social class may also have played a part.<ref>{{cite book

However, evidence on the relationship between religious belief and educational achievement is mixed. Some research in the United States has found that religiosity in general is correlated with greater educational attainment and scholastic performance. The effect of religion on education can differ depending on what type of religion a student professes. [[Fundamentalist]] Christians, especially women, tend to acquire fewer years of education than others do.<ref>Lehrer, E.L. (2004). ""Religiosity as a Determinant of Educational Attainment.""

As the strictest sense of positive atheism does not entail any specific beliefs outside of disbelief in God, atheists can hold any number of spiritual beliefs. For the same reason, atheists can hold a wide variety of ethical beliefs, ranging from the [[moral universalism]] of [[humanism]], which holds that a moral code should be applied consistently to all humans, to [[moral nihilism]], which holds that morality is meaningless.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1979|pp=21–22}}.</ref>

Throughout its history, however, atheism has commonly been equated with immorality, based on the belief that morality is directly derived from God, and thus cannot be attained without appealing to God.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1979|p=275}}. ""Among the many myths associated with religion, none is more widespread—or more disastrous in its effects—than the myth that moral values cannot be divorced from the belief in a god.""</ref><ref>In [[Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' (Book Eleven: ''Brother Ivan Fyodorovich'', Chapter 4) there is the famous argument that ''If there is no God, all things are permitted.'': ""'But what will become of men then?' I asked him, 'without God and immortal life? All things are lawful then, they can do what they like?'""</ref><ref name = ""Kant CPR A811""> For [[Kant]], the presupposition of God, soul, and freedom was a practical concern, for ""Morality, by itself, constitutes a system, but happiness does not, unless it is distributed in exact proportion to morality. This, however, is possible in an intelligible world only under a wise author and ruler.  Reason compels us to admit such a ruler, together with life in such a world, which we must consider as future life, or else all moral laws are to be considered as idle dreams… ."" (''Critique of Pure Reason'', A811).</ref> Moral precepts such as ""murder is wrong"" are seen as [[divine law]]s, requiring a divine lawmaker and judge. However, many atheists argue that treating morality legalistically involves a [[false analogy]], and that morality does not depend upon a lawmaker in the same way that laws do,<ref>{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=38}}.</ref> based on the [[Euthyphro dilemma]], which either renders God unnecessary or morality arbitrary.<ref>{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=39}}.</ref>

Philosopher [[Julian Baggini]] asserts that behaving ethically only because of divine mandate is not true ethical behavior but merely blind obedience.<ref> {{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=40}}.</ref> He argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves—to be able to discern, for example, that ""thou shalt steal"" is immoral even if one's religion instructs it—and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations.<ref>{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=43}}.</ref>

Atheists such as [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] have argued that Western religions' reliance on divine authority lends itself to [[authoritarianism]] and [[dogma]]tism.<ref>{{cite web | last = Harris | first = Sam | authorlink = Sam Harris (author) | title = The Myth of Secular Moral Chaos | url = http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php?section=library&page=sharris_26_3 | accessdate = 2006-10-29 | publisher = [[Free Inquiry]] | year = 2006a}}</ref> Indeed, [[religious fundamentalism]] and [[psychology of religion|extrinsic religion]] (when religion is held because it serves other, more ultimate interests<ref name=Moreira-almeida2006>{{cite journal | author = Moreira-almeida, A. | coauthors = Lotufo Neto, F.; Koenig, H.G. | year = 2006 | title = Religiousness and mental health: a review | journal = Revista Brasileira de Psiquiatria | volume = 28 | pages = 242–250 | url = http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1516-44462006000300018&script=sci_arttext  | accessdate = 2007-07-12 }}</ref>) have been correlated with authoritarianism, dogmatism, and prejudice.<ref>See for example: Kahoe, R.D.

'''Frederick Emmons Terman''' (June 7, 1900 in [[English, Indiana]] – December 19, 1982) was an [[United States|American]] academic. He is widely credited (together with [[William Shockley]]) with being the father of [[Silicon Valley]].<ref>[http://www.paloaltohistory.com/stanfordresearchpark.html Palo Alto History Project]</ref>

==Education==
Terman completed his undergraduate degree in [[chemistry]] and his master's degree in [[electrical engineering]] at [[Stanford University]]. His father [[Lewis Terman]], the man who popularized the [[IQ test]] in [[United States|America]], was a professor at Stanford. Terman went on to earn an [[ScD]] in electrical engineering from [[MIT]] in 1924. His advisor at MIT was [[Vannevar Bush]], who first proposed what became the [[National Science Foundation]].

==Academic career==
He returned to Stanford in 1925 as a member of the engineering faculty. From 1925 to 1941 Terman designed a course of study and research in electronics at Stanford that focused on work with vacuum tubes, circuits, and instrumentation. He also wrote ''Radio Engineering'' (first edition in 1932; second edition, much improved, in 1938; third edition in 1947 with added coverage of new technologies developed during World War II; fourth edition in 1955 with a new title, ''Electronic and Radio Engineering''), one of the most important books on electrical and radio engineering, and to this day a good reference on those subjects. Terman's students at Stanford included [[Oswald Garrison Villard, Jr.]], [[William Reddington Hewlett|William Hewlett]] and [[David Packard]]. He encouraged his students to form their own companies and personally invested in many of them, resulting in firms such as [[Litton Industries]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Terman was president of the [[Institute of Radio Engineers]] in 1941.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Frederick_Terman |title=Frederick Terman |author= |date= |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=09 August 2011}}</ref>

During World War II, Terman directed a staff of more than 850 at the [[Radio Research Laboratory]] at [[Harvard University]]. This organization was the source of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Radar jamming and deception|jammers]] to block enemy [[radar]], tunable receivers to detect radar signals, and aluminum strips (“chaff”) to produce spurious reflections on enemy radar receivers. These [[countermeasure]]s significantly reduced the effectiveness of radar-directed [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft fire]].

After the war Terman returned to Stanford and was appointed [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the School of Engineering. In 1951 he spearheaded the creation of Stanford Industrial Park (now [[Stanford Research Park]]), whereby the University leased portions of its land to high-tech firms.<ref>[http://otl.stanford.edu/about/documents/JSstanfordpark.pdf Sandelin, John, ''The Story of the Stanford Industrial/Research Park'', 2004]</ref> Companies such as [[Varian Associates]], Hewlett-Packard, [[Eastman Kodak]], [[General Electric]], and [[Lockheed Corporation]] moved into Stanford Industrial Park and made the mid-Peninsula area into a hotbed of innovation which eventually became known as [[Silicon Valley]].

He served as [[provost (education)|Provost]] at Stanford from 1955 to 1965. During his tenure, Terman greatly expanded the science, statistics and engineering departments in order to win more research grants from the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. These grants, in addition to the funds that the patented research generated, helped to catapult Stanford into the ranks of the world's first class educational institutions, as well as spurring the growth of [[Silicon Valley]]. 

In 1964, Dr. Terman became a [[List of founding members of the National Academy of Engineering|founding member]] of the [[National Academy of Engineering]].

==Quote==
Looking back on his creation in his declining years, Frederick Terman reflected, ""When we set  out  to  create  a  community  of  technical scholars  in  Silicon  Valley, there wasn't much here and the rest of the world looked awfully big.  Now a lot of the rest of the world is here.""<ref>[http://www.paloaltohistory.com/stanfordresearchpark.html Palo Alto History Project]</ref>
When once asked whether he wanted his university [Stanford] to be a teaching institution or a research institution, he replied that ""it should be a learning institution"".

==Recognition==
* He was awarded the [[IEEE Medal of Honor|IRE Medal of Honor]] in 1950 for ""his many contributions to the radio and electronic industry as teacher, author, scientist and administrator"".

'''''Hotel Chevalier''''' is a [[short film]] by director [[Wes Anderson]], released in 2007. Starring [[Jason Schwartzman]] and [[Natalie Portman]] as former lovers who reunite in a Paris hotel room, the 13-minute film acts as a [[prologue]] to Anderson's 2007 feature ''[[The Darjeeling Limited]]''. Shot on location in a Parisian hotel by a small crew, the film was self-financed by Anderson, who initially intended it to be a stand-alone work. It was first shown at the [[Venice Film Festival]] première of the feature film on September 2, 2007, and made its own debut later that month at [[Apple Store]]s in four American cities. The day after its première, it was made available for free from the [[iTunes Store]] for one month, during which it was downloaded more than 500,000 times. ''Hotel Chevalier'' became one of the most-discussed short films of the year, with much popular attention drawn in particular by Portman's extended nude scene. The film garnered near-universal critical acclaim, with reviewers praising its richness, poignancy and careful construction, and comparing it favorably with ''The Darjeeling Limited''.

==Synopsis==
<!-- Prelude -->
The film opens on a hotel lobby, where the [[concierge]] answers a ringing phone from one of the rooms. Cut to a man ([[Jason Schwartzman]]) who is lying on a hotel bed in a yellow [[bathrobe]], watching ''[[Stalag 17]]'' and reading the newspaper. After ordering room service from the concierge in broken French, he receives a call from a woman whose voice he recognizes. She tells him she is on her way from the airport and asks for his room number. Despite objecting that he did not tell her she could come, the man consents nevertheless. He then hurriedly attempts to tidy the room, pausing to play the opening bars of the song ""[[Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?]]"" on his stereo system, and runs a bath.

<!-- Arrival -->
When the film cuts to the next scene, the man is again lying on the bed, but has changed out of the bathrobe into a grey suit. Hearing a knock, he starts the song playing again before opening the door to a woman ([[Natalie Portman]]). After staring at him for several seconds, the woman breaks the silence by asking what music is playing. Receiving no response, she steps into the room and presents the man with a bouquet of flowers. When she moves to kiss him on the mouth, he turns his head away and they embrace instead. He closes the door and asks how she found him; she replies that it ""wasn't actually that hard"". She moves around the room browsing through his possessions, brushes her teeth with his toothbrush and declines to take the bath he had run for her.

<!-- Conflict -->
Stepping back into the bedroom, the woman turns to face the man and confronts him, asking slowly ""what the fuck is going on?"" He motions to her to join him on the bed and at her prompting, he reveals in the ensuing conversation that he has been living in the hotel room for ""more than a month"", and that he had left to escape their relationship. They lie back on the bed looking at one another before being interrupted by the arrival of room service. Once alone again, the two kiss and the man begins to undress the woman. They have a mutually mistrustful exchange about not having slept with other people; when, undressing her further he notices bruises on her arm, the woman chooses not to comment on them. Lying on top of him, she tells the man that she does not want to lose his friendship, that she loves him and never meant to hurt him. He responds coldly and dismissively, but holds her when she embraces him. ""Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?"" starts again and the man offers to show the woman his view of Paris.

<!-- Dénouement -->
In the next shot, the camera tracks across the room in slow motion, showing the woman perched against an armoire, the man approaching and covering her naked body with the yellow bathrobe, and the two moving towards the window. After they step out on the [[balcony]] together, the man draws a [[toothpick]] from his pocket and hands it to her with an upwards nod, which she reciprocates. After looking out at the scenery for another few seconds she clasps his neck lightly and they step back inside. The camera pans and it becomes evident that the view is completely blocked by another wing of the hotel.

==Background and production==
[[File:Hôtel Raphaël, Paris 1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A six storey building at the corner of a terrace lined in front by bare trees |The Hôtel Raphaël in Paris, which was used as the Hotel Chevalier of the film's title and where all of the scenes were shot]]
Director Wes Anderson first approached actors Schwartzman and Portman about ''Hotel Chevalier'' in 2005.<ref name=wsj/> Schwartzman and Anderson had previously worked on ''[[Rushmore (film)|Rushmore]]'', Anderson's cult second feature, while Portman was approached after the director obtained her email address from [[Scott Rudin]], producer of 2004's ''[[Closer (film)|Closer]]''.<ref name=latimes/> The actors appeared for free,<ref name=variety/> and Anderson financed the remainder of the production himself.<ref name=hindu/> It was filmed at the [[Hôtel Raphaël]] in Paris, which had previously been used as a setting for the films ''[[Love in Paris]]'' (1996) and ''[[Place Vendôme (film)|Place Vendôme]]'' (1998).<ref name=raphael/> It was shot by a crew of 15 using Panavision film stock and props from Anderson's apartment.<ref name=latimes/><ref name=hindu/> Filming took two and a half days, and editing (done on Anderson's computer) another week.<ref name=wsj/> Despite his use of a wardrobe from prestigious fashion designer [[Marc Jacobs]] and a handmade suitcase from [[Louis Vuitton]], the director described the production as ""like making a student film"".<ref name=latimes/>

Anderson initially intended it to be a stand-alone short film,<ref name=ifc/> but shortly before filming commenced, he realized that Schwartzman's character bore a close resemblance to one of the protagonists of a feature film he was writing at the time.<ref name=wsj/><ref name=ifc/> That film would begin production a year later as ''The Darjeeling Limited''.<ref name=wsj/> ''Chevalier'' takes place two weeks before Schwartzman's character (named Jack Whitman in the feature) joins his two older brothers on a journey in India in ''Darjeeling''.<ref name=latimes/> The dialogue exchanged by the characters at the end of ''Chevalier'' is recounted by Schwartzman's characters to his brothers at the close of the feature film, in the form of an excerpt from a short story he has composed.<ref name=corliss/> Portman's character has a brief cameo in the feature.<ref name=wsj/> [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the studio that backed ''Darjeeling'', was unaware of the short until the feature had been made and claimed to have no financial interest in it.<ref name=wsj/>{{-}}

''Hotel Chevalier'' was screened as part of the program at the world première of ''The Darjeeling Limited'' at the 64th Annual [[Venice Film Festival]] on September 2, 2007.<ref name=corliss/> The short had its own première at [[Apple Store]]s in New York City, Chicago, San Francisco and Santa Monica, California, on September 25.<ref name=wsj/><ref name=variety/> Anderson, Schwartzman and Portman appeared at the New York screening in [[SoHo]], after which they held a questions-and-answers session with the audience.<ref name=wsj/><ref name=variety/> The short was made available the following day as a free download from Apple's [[iTunes Store]].<ref name=wsj/> On September 28, it preceded the showing of the feature on the opening night of the 2007 [[New York Film Festival]].<ref name=nyff/> A press release posted before the première ""the brief coda to a doomed romance and the prologue to ''The Darjeeling Limited''"".<ref name=slashfilm/>

The film was withdrawn from iTunes after having been available for download for a month.<ref name=nyt/> Although it had been dismissed by ''[[USA Today]]'' columnist Susan Wloszczyna before its iTunes release as an ''[[amuse-bouche]]'' that was ""destined to be a mere footnote"",<ref name=usatoday/> the short was downloaded nearly 500,000 times during its run, and received wide acclaim.<ref name=nyt/> The film drew some attention for co-star Natalie Portman's extended nude scene, and for her character's bruised body.<ref name=wsj/><ref name=breznican/><ref name=sequels/> Following its withdrawal from iTunes, the short was distributed in theaters as the prologue to the feature-length film.<ref name=nyt/> Although ''The New York Times'' reported in October 2007 that distributor [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] intended to promote ''Chevalier'' as a competitor for the [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film|Best Live Action Short Film]] of the Academy Awards,<ref name=nyt/> it was not among that year's nominations.<ref name=oscars/> It was included as an extra on the ''Darjeeling'' 2008 DVD release,<ref name=nyff/> and Anderson's screenplay for the short was published in the Winter 2007 issue of the literary magazine ''[[Zoetrope: All-Story]]''.<ref name=zoetrope/>

==Critical reception==
Apart from being one of the year's most discussed short films,<ref name=latimes/> ''Hotel Chevalier'' attracted considerable critical praise, with reviewers comparing it favorably to ''The Darjeeling Limited''. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Gary Susman described it as ""an exquisite short story where we learn not much but exactly enough about these two characters"", adding that ""''Chevalier'' sees Anderson working in his customary jewel-box/dollhouse mode, but the form and length really suit each other here.""<ref name=susman/> In ''[[New York Press]]'', Armand White judged the short ""moving and genuinely contemporary"", citing its ""lost-girl poignancy"".<ref name=nyp/> Portman's performance was praised by ''TIME'' reviewer [[Richard Corliss]], who declared her to be ""a comic actress in fresh bloom"" in the ""beguiling vignette"", and expressed his wish that her role in ''Darjeeling'' had been greater.<ref name=corliss/> The feature, he felt, lacked the ""the feeling and wit of the short film"".<ref name=corliss/> [[Salon.com]]'s Stephanie Zacharek concurred, stating that ""the untold story of ''Hotel Chevalier'' is 10 times more interesting, and infinitely richer, than the one told outright in ''The Darjeeling Limited''"", and calling the short ""darn near perfect"".<ref name=salon/> ''The Guardian'' columnist Danny Leigh contrasted the lukewarm reception of the feature among bloggers and critics with the ""genuine ardour"" that greeted the ""perfectly measured narrative"" of ''Chevalier''. He proposed that the constraints of the short-film format suited Anderson, whose trademark deadpan humor, idiosyncratic set designs and choice of soundtrack inclined to exhaust the viewers' patience in a feature-length work.<ref name=grauniad/> [[A. O. Scott]] of ''The New York Times'' hailed ''Chevalier'' as ""a small gem"" in comparison to the ""overstuffed suitcase"" of the feature, and wrote that ""It is worth seeking out, not only because it fleshes out part of the story of the Whitman brothers but also because, on its own, it is an almost perfect distillation of Mr. Anderson’s vexing and intriguing talents, enigmatic, affecting and wry.""<ref name=nyff/>

==History==
In 1960, Brian Lloyd and Alastair Macleod, two experienced shipping managers and [[shipbroking]] partners, began formulating plans to take over an existing airline as part of a [[diversification]] [[strategic management|strategy]] into the airline business. After months of unsuccessfully trying to raise capital for their planned acquisition, financial backing was finally obtained the following year from [[Bolivia]]n tin magnate J. Ortiz-Patiño<ref name=""Lloyd_grounding""/> and [[Greece|Greek]] shipping magnate Nicholas Mavroleon to set up a new airline from scratch. This airline was to specialise in Far East ""tramping"", concentrating on ships' crews and freight. The founders chose the name ''Lloyd'' for their new venture. J. Ortiz-Patiño and Nicholas Mavroleon became the respective [[chairman|chairmen]] of the airline and of [[Hong Kong]]-[[incorporation (business)|incorporate]]d Far East Aviation Company Ltd, a group [[holding company]].<ref name=""Lloyd_61""/><ref>''Aeroplane — Biography of a Supertramp'', Vol. 112, No. 2863, pp. 20, 23, Temple Press, London, 1 September 1966</ref><ref name=""ownership1"">[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%200262.html ''Flight International'', 22 February 1968, ''Air Transport ...'', ''Looking into Lloyd'', p. 256]</ref><ref name=""ownership2"">[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%200302.html ''Flight International'', 29 February 1968, ''Air Transport ...'', ''Lloyd reorganisation'', p. 296]</ref>

Lloyd International Airways commenced operations in 1961 with a Douglas DC-4 acquired from [[Iceland]]ic airline [[Loftleiðir]].<ref name=""Lloyd_start""/> Its first engagement was a series of charter flights carrying ship crews between the [[United Kingdom]] and several destinations in the Far East.<ref name=""Lloyd_69""/><ref name=""BUA_Britannias"">[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1969/1969%20-%200101.html ''Flight International'', 16 January 1969, ''Lloyd increases Britannia fleet'', p. 83]</ref> It soon found other charter work for the aircraft, which led to the acquisition of two more DC-4s in 1962.

Lloyd International's first two years of operations were unprofitable, mainly as a result of uneconomic charter rates caused by excess capacity. Other contributing factors included an expensive emergency [[aircraft lease|lease]] of a replacement aircraft for a [[Douglas DC-4|DC-4]] destroyed in a refuelling fire and high [[full cost accounting#Overhead and indirect costs|overhead]]s due to a top-heavy administrative structure.<ref name=""Supertramp_20"">''Aeroplane — Biography of a Supertramp'', Vol. 112, No. 2863, p. 20 Temple Press, London, 1 September 1966</ref>

[[Budget]]ing and [[management accounting|cost control]], introduced in 1963, ensured that charterers were only quoted profitable rates. This resulted in a partial withdrawal from the cut-throat British [[inclusive tour]] (IT) market and the opening of an office in Hong Kong to capture a greater share of lucrative Far East cargo traffic.<ref name=""Supertramp_20""/>

To ensure every single operation showed a clear profit on a [[full cost accounting|full costing]] basis, ie inclusive of all [[operating cost#overhead (business)|overhead cost]]s, the company required each operation to be budgeted in detail before deciding whether to accept it. The [[managing director]]'s authorisation was required to dispense with this rule in exceptional cases where the risk of accepting a contract that was only marginally profitable, ie excluding overheads, was outweighed by the risk of having an aircraft sit idly on the ground. An immediate financial analysis that compared [[cost accounting|actual cost]]s and [[cost accounting#revenue|revenue]]s with their budgets followed the completion of each flight, thereby instantly gauging that flight's profitability and validating the effectiveness of the firm's pricing policy. A policy of requiring [[pilot in command|aircraft commander]]s to pay for all [[operating expense]]s other than fuel in cash proved to be an effective method to exercise instant cost control over fees and charges incurred for products and services supplied by third parties, such as [[aircraft ground handling|ground handling]] fees, technical support services and catering supplies.<ref>''Aeroplane — Biography of a Supertramp'', Vol. 112, No. 2863, pp. 20, 22 Temple Press, London, 1 September 1966</ref>

In addition, the principle of strict cost control was also applied to [[aircraft maintenance]] and flight operations. This entailed [[outsourcing]] all engineering work as the fleet was too small to warrant Lloyd International setting up its own maintenance department. It furthermore involved ""buying"" flying hours at a fixed rate.<ref name=""Supertramp_22"">''Aeroplane — Biography of a Supertramp'', Vol. 112, No. 2863, p. 22 Temple Press, London, 1 September 1966</ref> Moreover, through [[Wheelock|Wheelock Marden]], Lloyd International was indirectly associated with the [[HAECO|Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company]]. This enabled it to draw on that company's extensive spares pool in Hong Kong.<ref name=""Supertramp_23"">''Aeroplane — Biography of a Supertramp'', Vol. 112, No. 2863, p. 23 Temple Press, London, 1 September 1966</ref> (Other than Hong Kong, Lloyd International pursued a policy of not stationing any spares along regular routes flown by its aircraft. Instead each aircraft carried its own spares kit — usually consisting of a spare wheel and brake — and a ground engineer.<ref name=""Supertramp_23""/>)

In the context of Lloyd International's management's firm belief in exercising tight control over ist costs regarding all aspects of the airline's operations, it is of interest to note that flightdeck crews were instructed to operate their aircraft in high-speed cruise mode despite the resulting higher [[operating cost]]s due to increased fuel consumption. In an era of low [[aviation fuel#Jet fuel|jet fuel]] prices, this was the most economical option when taking into account the then statutory limit for [[aircrew]] to fly up to 115 hours in 28 days, the fact that engineering costs were charged on a flat hourly basis and that there were generally few opportunities to take advantage of differentials in fuel prices at different stations served by the airline.<ref name=""Supertramp_23""/>

In 1964, Brian Lloyd, one of the airline's founders, sold out while well-established Far East trading company Wheelock Marden bought into the company by acquiring a 33% stake in the business. The latter transaction put Wheelock Marden's sales offices in [[Bangkok]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Singapore]] and [[Tokyo]] at the airline's disposal. The same year, Lloyd International acquired its first [[Douglas DC-6]] (an A/B series model), the airline's first [[cabin pressurization|pressurise]]d aircraft. This was also the year the airline's operating base moved from [[Cambridge Airport|Cambridge]] to [[London Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]].<ref name=""Supertramp_20""/><ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1964/1964%20-%200913.html ''Flight International'', 2 April 1964, ''World Airline Survey ...'', p. 518]</ref>

In January 1965, Lloyd International decided to acquire two Bristol Britannia 312s turboprops from [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC) and to have them fitted with special doors and stronger floors to allow the carriage of large-size palletised freight consignments. The first aircraft joined the fleet in April of that year. [[Aviation Traders]] won the contract to convert the Britannias into freighters. This involved fitting the aircraft with large forward cargo doors and strengthening the cabin floors. Conversion began during the 1965/6 winter season. This enabled the company to concentrate on long-haul charters, especially between [[Europe]] and the Far East. While these aircraft were primarily intended for freight operations, they were also used to transport passengers.<ref name=""Lloyd_reequipment""/><ref name=""Supertramp_20""/><ref name=""ATL_Conversions"">[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1966/1966%20-%200494.html ''Flight International'', 24 February 1966, ''Far East freighting prospects'', p. 299]</ref>

In 1966, the Hong Kong Air Transport Licensing Authority (ATLA) awarded Lloyd International Airways (Hong Kong) Freighters, an associate company of Lloyd International, a licence to operate twice-weekly all-cargo services between Hong Kong and [[London]]. The licence was valid from 1 April 1966, for five years. The same month, the airline sold the [[Douglas DC-6|DC-6]]A/B that had been acquired 18 months earlier. Nineteen sixty-six was also the year Neckermann und Reisen, the [[tour operator]] of [[West Germany|West German]] mail-order concern [[Arcandor|Neckermann]], contracted Lloyd International to launch a series of weekday IT flights from [[Berlin-Tegel Airport#Other operators|Tegel Airport]] in what used to be [[West Berlin|West Berlin's French sector]] in the days prior to [[German reunification|Germany's reunification]]. These flights were operated with Britannias.<ref>[http://www.airliners.net/photo/Lloyd-International-Airways/Bristol-175-Britannia/1238224/L/ Bristol 175 Britannia 312F aircraft (picture)]</ref> They served principal [[Europe]]an holiday resorts in the Mediterranean and the [[Canary Islands]]. The combination of these flights with a similar series of weekend IT flights from [[Scotland]] on behalf of a British tour operator fully utilised one Britannia for that summer season.<ref name=""Supertramp_22""/><ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1966/1966%20-%200570.html ''Flight International'', 3 March 1966, ''Lloyd's West German IT deal'', p. 339]</ref>

In 1967, Lloyd International shifted its main operating base from Gatwick to [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted]]. The latter also became the location of the airline's headquarters, which had been located in [[Central London]] since its inception.<ref name=""Lloyd_69""/>

In 1968, Lloyd International and its associated companies underwent a reorganisation. This resulted in the creation of Lloyd International Airways (Holding) as the group's [[holding company]] with J. Ortiz-Patiño as chairman. Lloyd International Airways (Holding) acquired the entire share capital of Lloyd International Airways, Lloyd Aircraft Services, Brokaloyd and other associated companies. Effectively, this constituted a transfer of shares from Aviation Management, a company based in Hong Kong, to the new British holding company.<ref name=""ownership1""/><ref name=""ownership2""/>

In 1969, Lloyd International purchased two former [[British United Airways]] (BUA) Britannia 307s. This doubled the size of the airline's Britannia fleet to four aircraft. These aircraft were fully convertible, with large freight doors. They could either be operated as pure freighters, in a mixed passenger/cargo configuration or as all-passenger aircraft seating up to 132 passengers. The addition of these aircraft gave the airline greater flexibility in its core long-distance charter operation, which mainly consisted of ''ad hoc'' passenger/seamen and cargo flights between Europe and the Far East, primarily to and from Hong Kong. Lloyd International also developed additional sales and promotional facilities on the Europe — Hong Kong route in association with the Ben Line, a well-known [[Far East]]ern [[shipping line]],<ref>[http://www.benlineagencies.com/aboutus.asp ''Ben Line Agencies'' - About us]</ref><ref>[http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/ben.htm ''The Ships List'', The Fleets, Ben Line / William Thomson & Co.]</ref> to increase air cargo volumes.<ref name=""Lloyd_69""/><ref name=""BUA_Britannias""/>

Lloyd International's first [[jet aircraft]], an ex-[[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] [[Boeing 707]]-321, entered service in 1970. Lloyd's new long-haul jet operated affinity group flights across the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] to the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] as well as passenger and freight charters to the Far East.<ref name=""Lloyd_69""/><ref name=""FarEast_charters""/><ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1970/1970%20-%200539.html ''Flight International'', 26 March 1970, ''World Airlines 1970'', p. 489]</ref>

In January 1971, Lloyd International entered into an agreement with [[East African Airways]] Corporation (EAAC) to operate scheduled all-cargo services on the latter's behalf between London, [[Dar es Salaam|Dar-es-Salaam]], [[Nairobi]], [[Entebbe]] and [[Lusaka]]. This was also the year the airline acquired two more [[Boeing 707|707]]s, another -321 and a -324C. The latter was a convertible aircraft that could either be operated in an all-passenger, all-cargo or mixed passenger/cargo configuration. It was also the company's first [[turbofan]]-powered jet.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1971/1971%20-%200720.html ''Flight International'', 6 May 1971, ''World Airlines'', p. 635]</ref>

In early-1972 Lloyd International increased its Far East Britannia freight services from six to eight a month, resulting in a twice-weekly operation to Singapore and Hong Kong. The increase in flight frequencies would have boosted annual available cargo capacity to 3.25[[million|m]] [[kilogram|kg]]. This compared with an actual freight volume of 1.5m kg the previous year, representing an average load factor of 79% eastbound and 71% westbound. There was also a plan to operate all Far East freight services with an all-jet fleet entirely composed of convertible, turbofan-powered 707-320Cs by 1975.<ref name=""FarEast_boost""/><ref name=Lloyd_72>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1972/1972%20-%201291.html ''Flight International'', 18 May 1972, ''World Airline Directory'', p. 31]</ref>

Lloyd International's rapidly deteriorating financial performance as a result of cancellations and overcapacity in the low-[[yield (finance)|yield]] [[transatlantic flight|transatlantic]] affinity group market,<ref>''Fly me, I'm Freddie!'', Eglin, R. and Ritchie, B., Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1980, p. 139</ref> as well as the [[Her Majesty's Government|Government]]'s refusal to direct the [[BAA Limited|British Airports Authority]] (BAA) to reduce airport user charges at Stansted and its preferential treatment of [[British Caledonian#Inception|British Caledonian]] by making it the private sector's ""chosen instrument"" as part of the official ""Second Force"" policy, compelled it to cease all operations on 16 June 1972 and to go into [[liquidation]].<ref name=""Lloyd_grounding""/><ref name=""Lloyd_bankruptcy""/><ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1972/1972%20-%201676.html ''Flight International'', 29 June 1972, ''Sticking up for Stansted'', p. 961]</ref>

There is one recorded non-fatal accident involving Lloyd International Airways.<ref name=""Lloyd_accident"">[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1961/1961%20-%201489.html ''Flight International'', 12 October 1961, ''Air Commerce'', ''Derby Aviation DC-3 accident'', p. 593]</ref><ref>[http://aviation-safety.net/database/operator/airline.php?var=5752 Aviation Safety Network database – Lloyd International Airways accidents/incidents]</ref>

On 8 October 1961 a Lloyd International Airways Douglas C-54A-1-DC (registration: G-ARLF) burnt out at [[Málaga Airport]] following the explosion of a petrol tanker during refuelling. The aircraft had arrived at [[Málaga]] from [[Tanger]] and was due to depart to [[Manchester]]. Although it was destroyed as a result of the explosion, none of the 34 passengers who had arrived on board the ill-fated aircraft and the other 32 who were due to join the flight were injured because they were waiting inside the airport building at the time of the accident. However, those who had started their journey in Tanger lost all their luggage.<ref name=""Lloyd_accident""/><ref>[http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19611008-0 ASN Aircraft accident description Douglas C-54A-1-DC G-ARLF - Málaga Airport (AGP)]</ref>

[[PlayStation 3]] owners can purchase a wealth of accessories that are designed for or are compatible with the Playstation 3 system.
These accessories include game controllers, audio and video input devices like microphones and video cameras, and cables for improved sound and picture quality.

== Sixaxis ==<!--This section is linked from redirects [[Sixaxis]] and [[SIXAXIS]]-->
[[Image:Sixaxis ps3 controller.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Playstation 3's Sixaxis wireless controller]]
The '''Sixaxis Wireless Controller''' (trademarked ""SIXAXIS"") was the official wireless [[video game controller|controller]] for the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation 3]], later to be succeeded by the [[Dualshock#DualShock 3|DualShock 3]].
In [[Japan]], individual Sixaxis controllers were available for purchase simultaneously with the console's launch, without a USB to USB mini cable.
The word ""Sixaxis"" (contraction of ""six axis"" for the directional movements) is a [[palindrome]].
 
=== History ===
At [[E3]] [[2005]], [[Sony]] showcased their ""boomerang"" design for the [[PlayStation 3]]'s controller.  Accompanied by much criticism, most of which were for its looks, this design was later abandoned. Sony later stated that the original controller ""was very clearly designed as a design concept, and was never intended to be the final controller, despite what everybody said about it.""<ref name=""Phil Harrison Interview interview"">{{cite web|last=Fahey|first=Rob|date=[[2006-05-12]]|url=http://www.gamesindustry.net/content_page.php?aid=16969|title= E³: Sony's Phil Harrison|work=GamesIndustry.biz|accessdate=2006-08-30}}</ref>
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Playstation 3 Controlller.jpg|thumb|The final design, currently used]] -->

The boomerang design was replaced by an altered, wireless version of the [[Dualshock#DualShock 2|DualShock 2]] controller at [[E3]] [[2006]]

The Sixaxis controller is currently being phased out, and the [[DualShock 3]] is the new official controller, which in addition to a vibration feature will still include Sixaxis functionality. However Europe will still have the Sixaxis controller during summer as the European ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' PlayStation 3 bundle includes a Sixaxis. <ref>[http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2008/04/02/sony-non-shocker-sixaxis-discontinued/ MTV Multiplayer » Sony Non-Shocker: Sixaxis Discontinued<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The Sixaxis is no longer being produced.

==== Feature and design changes ====

The Sixaxis can operate for up to 30 hours on a full charge. The battery was originally not thought to be replaceable when a Sony spokesperson stated that the Sixaxis should operate for ""many years before there's any degradation in terms of battery performance. When and if this happens, then of course [[Sony]] will be providing a service to exchange these items"".<ref name=""battery life and replacement"">[http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=20528 Sony to replace PS3 controllers // GamesIndustry.biz<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Later, it was revealed that the Sixaxis came with instructions on how to remove the battery and that the battery was fully removable.<ref>[http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/home-entertainment/ps3-sixaxis-controllers-battery-is-kinda-replaceable-214144.php gizmodo.com]</ref>

A major feature of the controller is the ability to sense both [[rotation]]al orientation and [[Translation (geometry)|translational]] [[acceleration]] along all three dimensional axes, providing [[six degrees of freedom]].<ref name=""pr_control"">{{cite press release|publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.|date=[[2006-05-09]]|title=SCE ANNOUNCES NEW CONTROLLER FOR PLAYSTATION3||format=PDF|url=http://www.scei.co.jp/corporate/release/pdf/060509be.pdf|accessdate=2006-05-24}}</ref> This became a matter of controversy, as the circumstances of the announcement, made less than eight months after [[Nintendo]] revealed motion-sensing capabilities in its new game console controller (see [[Wii Remote]]), led to speculation that the addition of motion-sensing was a late-stage decision by [[Sony]] to follow Nintendo's move. Further fueling the speculation was the fact that only one game shown at [[E3]] that year demonstrated the motion-sensing feature. {{Fact|date=March 2007}}  Also, some comments from [[Incognito Entertainment]], the developer behind the motion-sensing [[PlayStation 3]] game, [[Warhawk (PlayStation 3)|Warhawk]], said that it received development controllers with the motion-sensing feature only 10 days or so before E3.<ref name=""ten_days"">{{cite web|publisher=Kotaku|date=[[2006-05-12]]|title=Incognito Had 10 Days To Design Warhammer's Tilt-Sensitive Controls|url=http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/incognito/incognito-had-10-days-to-design-warhammers-tiltsensitive-controls-173405.php|accessdate=2007-01-01}}</ref> Developer Brian Upton from [[SCE Studios Santa Monica]] later clarified that the Incognito had been secretly working on the motion-sensing technology ""for a while"", but did not receive a working controller until ""the last few weeks before E3"".<ref name=""eurogamer"">{{cite web|publisher=Eurogamer|date=N/A|title=WarHawk dev knew about tilt|url=
http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=65844|accessdate=2007-01-01}}</ref>

The Sixaxis features finer analog sensitivity than the [[DualShock 2]], increased to 10-bit precision from the 8-bit precision of the DualShock 2.<ref>[http://www.us.playstation.com/PS3/Accessories/SCPH-98040 PlayStation.com - PLAYSTATION®3 - Accessories - SIXAXIS™ Wireless Controller<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The frame around the L2 and R2 buttons has been omitted, resulting in more trigger-like buttons, with an increased range of depression. In the place of the ""Analog"" mode button switch of previous dual analog models is a jewel-like ""PS button"" with the PlayStation logo, which can be used to access the home menu, switch controller inputs and turn the console or the controller on or off.

Some Sixaxis are made from translucent plastic, which, when held against light, reveals the inner components of the controller.

====LED lights====
[[Image:ps3 Led Lights.JPG|thumb|right|The top of a SIXAXIS controller, LED lights on the right.]]
A row of four numbered [[light-emitting diode|LED]] port indicators are on the top of the controller, to identify and distinguish multiple wireless controllers. Due to there being only four player LEDs on the controller itself, multiple indicators light up for players 5, 6 and 7 (for example, if the '4' and '1' indicators are illuminated at the same time, the controller is assigned to Player 5). While the PS3 is turned on, pressing the PS button will bring up a menu displaying the battery charge of all synced controllers among other options.

=== Partial list of games that support 5-7 players offline ===

The following games support 7 players offline on a single screen unless otherwise noted. In addition to Sony-made controllers, most any USB controller will work due to the PS3's plug-and-play capabilities.{{fact|date=November 2008}} Due to the Xbox 360 controller requiring driver support, it will not function, but most PC controllers will, in addition to PS2 controllers connected via a PS2-to-USB adapter.

====Removal of vibration capability====
Sony announced that because of the included motion sensors, the vibration feature of previous PlayStation controllers was removed, stating that the vibration would interfere with motion-sensing.<ref name=""pr_control"" /> This therefore made the PS3 wireless controller incredibly light, which felt strange to players accustomed to heavier controllers such as the [[DualShock]]. [[Haptic]]s developer [[Immersion Corporation]], which had successfully sued Sony for patent infringement,<ref name=""Immersion suit"">{{cite press release|publisher=Immersion Corporation|date=[[2005-03-08]]|title=Immersion Obtains $90.7 Million Judgment in Patent Infringement Case Against Sony|url=http://immr.client.shareholder.com/ReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=158652|accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref> expressed skepticism of Sony's rationale, with company president Victor Viegas stating in an interview, ""I don’t believe it’s a very difficult problem to solve, and Immersion has experts that would be happy to solve that problem for them,"" under the condition that Sony withdraw its appeal of the patent infringement ruling.<ref name=""Viegas interview"">{{cite web|last=Murdey|first=Chase|date=[[2006-05-17]]|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20060517/murdey_01.shtml|title= Ready to Rumble? Immersion's Victor Viegas on PlayStation 3's Lack of Vibration|work=Gamasutra|publisher=CMP Media LLC|accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref> Immersion later emphasized compatibility with motion-sensing when introducing its next-generation vibration feedback technology, TouchSense.<ref name=""TouchSense announcement"">{{cite press release|publisher=Immersion Corporation|date=[[2006-06-19]]|title=Immersion Corporation Introduces Next-Generation Vibration Technology for Video Console Gaming Systems|url=http://immr.client.shareholder.com/ReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=201102|accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref>  Subsequent statements from Sony were dismissive of the arguments from Immersion, with [[Sony Computer Entertainment America]] (SCEA) Senior VP of Marketing Peter Dille stating, ""It seems like the folks at Immersion are looking to sort of negotiate through the press and try to make their case to us&nbsp;… we've talked about how there's a potential for that rumble to interfere with the Sixaxis controller.""<ref name=""Peter_Dille>[http://www.engadget.com/2006/11/06/the-engadget-interview-peter-dille-sony-computer-entertainment/  Engadget.com]</ref>

However, in a press release made some eight months later, [[Phil Harrison]], Sony's president of worldwide studios, said: ""Now, rumble I think was the last generation feature; it's not the next-generation feature. I think motion sensitivity is."" He added that rumbling would, in the future, only come from third-party controllers. <ref name=""Phil Harrison quote about rumble being 'last gen'"">{{cite press release|publisher=GameDaily BIZ|date=[[2007-02-26]]|title=Sony: Rumble is a 'Last Generation Feature'|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3157501}}</ref>.  That statement was proven false less than a year later, with the announcement of the ''[[DualShock 3]]''.

=== Partial list of games using Sixaxis motion sensor ===
It should be noted that some of the demo versions of these games do not allow use of the motion sensor.

{{main|DualShock#DualShock 3|l1=DualShock - DualShock 3}}

The DualShock 3 will be the official PlayStation 3 controller, replacing the SIXAXIS completely (while keeping the functionality of SIXAXIS). At its press conference at the 2007 [[Tokyo Game Show]], Sony announced the [[DualShock|DualShock 3]] (trademarked ""DUALSHOCK 3""), a PlayStation 3 controller with the same function and design as the Sixaxis, but with vibration capability.<ref name=""DualShock 3 PR"">{{cite web |url=http://www.scei.co.jp/corporate/release/070920be.html |title=DualShock 3 Wireless Controller With Rumble Feature To Be Introduced FOR PLAYSTATION3 |accessdate=2007-09-20 |date=2007-09-20 |work= |publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment}}</ref>.

On [[November 11]] [[2007]], the official DualShock 3 controller was released in Japan, in Piano Black and Ceramic White, as well as Satin Silver (to match the Japanese color variations of the 40GB PS3 model). Software patches to provide a vibration function in previously-released PS3 software were made available.

== PlayStation Eye ==
{{main|PlayStation Eye}}
The '''PlayStation Eye''' is an updated version of the EyeToy [[USB]] [[webcam]] designed for the PlayStation 3. It will not work with PS2 EyeToy games, but the PS3 does support the [[PlayStation 2]] [[EyeToy]], using its camera and microphone functionalities.  A firmware update enabled the PlayStation 3 to support all USB webcams which used the [[USB video device class|USB Video Class]]
{{-}}

==PlayTV==
{{mainarticle|PlayTV}}
Officially announced [[August 22]], [[2007]]; '''PlayTV''' is a twin-channel [[DVB-T]] tuner peripheral with [[digital video recorder]] (DVR) software which allows users to record television programs to the PlayStation 3 hard drive for later viewing. Programs can be recorded while playing a game. The device was launched in the UK on the 19 September 2008 with other regions in Europe to follow. [5]

It has been reported that Australia will receive the Play TV accessory only 2 months after Europe. Currently earmarked for Q4 2008 [6]

Because North American markets, including the United States, Canada, and Mexico will be using the ATSC digital standard (and the latter two are currently early in their digital transition), it is unlikely they will see the PlayTV device because of compatibility issues.

== Headsets ==
[[Image:Official_PS3_Wireless_Bluetooth_Headset.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Official PS3 Wireless Bluetooth Headset]]
{{further|[[List of Bluetooth headsets compatible with PlayStation 3]]}}
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Warhawkheadset.jpg|thumb|A Bluetooth [[Headphones|headset]]]] -->
Most commercial [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] headsets are compatible with the [[PlayStation 3]]. In addition, the PlayStation 3 supports some [[PlayStation 2]] USB accessories, including the  USB ''[[SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs]]'' headset by [[Logitech]], the ''[[SingStar]]'' microphones and the built-in microphone on the Eyetoy for video and voice chat (although the EyeToy Play game associated with the EyeToy is not available for use on European PlayStation 3s ).  Since the PlayStation 3 supports Bluetooth technology, any type of wireless headset is compatible with the system<ref name=""pr_specs"">{{cite press release|title=Any Bluetooth headset compatible with PS3|url=http://www.playstatic.com/news/180|accessdate=2006-11-11}}</ref>; however, Bluetooth wireless headsets are not compatible with PlayStation 2 games which use the USB headsets (due to being programmed for them only) and therefore the USB headsets must still be used (though this could potentially be solved with future firmware updates). On Sept. 12, 2007, Logitech announced<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/172/3790&cl=us,en |title=Logitech Unveils Bluetooth-Enabled Headset and Keyboard Designed for PLAYSTATION 3 |publisher=Logitech |date=[[2007-09-12]]}}</ref> new, Cordless Vantage Headset for Playstation 3. The Blu-ray Disc retail version of ''[[Warhawk (PlayStation 3 game)|Warhawk]]'' comes bundled with a [[Jabra]] BT125 Bluetooth headset in North America and the [[Jabra]] BT135 in Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://games.ign.com/articles/817/817415p1.html |title=Warhawk Released |accessdate= |last=Dunham |first=Alexis |date=[[2007-08-28]] |publisher=IGN}}</ref>

On June 27, 2008, it was announced that the headset that will be paired with the Blu-ray Disc version of ''[[SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Confrontation]]'' will be the official Bluetooth headset for the PlayStation 3 <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.play.com/Games/PlayStation3/4-/6704615/Official-PS3-Wireless-Bluetooth-Headset/Product.html |title=Official PS3 Wireless Bluetooth Headset |publisher=Play.com}}</ref> (see image).
It will boast exclusive features such as a mute button, and will come with a charging cradle so that it may charge while connected to one of the system's [[USB 2.0|USB]] ports <ref>{{cite web|url=http://socom.us.playstation.com/post/2008/06/Media-Day-03-Bluetooth%c2%ae.aspx |title=Media Day 03: Bluetooth®!? |accessdate= |last=Brothers |first=David |date=[[2008-06-27]] |publisher=SOCOM.com}}</ref>, which is being marketed as being useful for storing when not in use.

The official headset allows for high quality voice-chat, and provides volume level, battery level, charging status and connection status indicators on the PS3's on-screen display. The headset can be used as a microphone when docked in the charging cradle - voice output from PS3 is automatically transferred to the TV in this case.

== BD Remote == 

The PlayStation 3 '''BD Remote''' (CECHZR1) allows users to control videos and music on [[Blu-ray Disc]] and [[DVD]] through [[Bluetooth]]. In Japan, the device was available as of [[December 7]], [[2006]]. The device was available in North America as of December[http://ps3.ign.com/articles/740/740460p1.html]. It uses 2 1.5 volt AA batteries.
Since the remote communicates with the console using Bluetooth, which utilizes [[radio waves]], the device does not need to be pointed at the console to function; as is the case with traditional [[infrared]] [[Remote control#Television Remote Controls|remotes]]. However, this fact means that an adapter is needed to use a ""universal"" infra-red remote control on the PS3.
{{-}}

== Memory Card Adaptor ==

The [[PlayStation 3]] '''Memory Card Adaptor''' (CECHZM1) is a device that allows data to be transferred from a [[PlayStation]] memory card or a [[PlayStation 2]] memory card to the PlayStation 3's [[hard disk]]. At launch, the device did not support transferring saved game files back to a memory card, but the upon release of the PlayStation 3 system software version 1.80, the user is now able to save and/or transfer PSOne and PS2 game saves from the PS3 directly onto a physical Memory Card via the adaptor. PlayStation 2 saved game files can also be transferred between PlayStation 3 users via other current memory card formats. The device connects to the PlayStation 3's USB port on one end through a USB Mini-B cable (not included with adaptor, but it was included with the console itself), and features a legacy PlayStation 2 memory card port on the other end. The adaptor was available for purchase simultaneously with the console's launch. The Memory Card Adaptor was released on [[25 May]] [[2007]] in the UK.

== AC adapter charging kit ==
AC adapter Charging Kit can charge Sixaxis and/or DualShock 3 controller, official Bluetooth headset and the soon to be released Wireless Keypad. The kit can also charge the PSP-2000 and PSP-3000. AC Charger uses a wall power plug so you don't need to have a PS3 running to charge the hardware.

== Wireless Keypad ==
[[Image:PS3_Wireless_Keypad_01.jpg|thumb|200px|Promotional Image of Wireless Keypad]]
A wireless keypad peripheral <ref name=""Keypad"">{{cite web|last=Crecente|first=Brian|date=[[2008-08-20]]|url=http://kotaku.com/5039502/ps3-wireless-keypad-ships-this-holiday-worldwide|title= PS3 Wireless keypad ships this holiday worldwide|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=2008-08-20}}</ref> was launched in Europe on November 28, 2008.<ref>http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=308073</ref> It will be launched in North America in early December 2008, and some time late 2008 in Japan. The keypad can be connected to a PlayStation 3 via Bluetooth, or connected to a controller. 

The keypad features two shortcut buttons, a Communication Button and a Message Box Button, letting users jump to pre-set features on the XMB such as the Friends screen and Message Box during game play.
The Touch Pad Button allows PS3 users to use the surface of the keypad as a touch pad, allowing them to move the pointer whilst web browsing by sliding their fingers around the keypad surface.
The Bluetooth-enabled device will support and all typing on the PlayStation 3, including text chatting in ''Home'' and ''LittleBigPlanet'' support.

== AV cables ==

Both official [[HDMI]] cables and standard HDMI cables (ver 1.2 / 1.3) are also compatible. An official component AV cable set is also available. Also, composite, S-Video, [[RGB]] [[SCART]] and component cables for the PlayStation 2 are all compatible with the PlayStation 3, as they utilize the same ""[[AV Multi|A/V Multi Out]]"" port.<ref>[http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/settings/videooutput.html PlayStation 3 User's Guide - Video Output Settings]</ref>

On the audio part, AV cables connected to the ""AV Multi out"" allows 2.0ch ([[stereo]]) only, optical ""Digital out"" allows both 2.0ch and 5.1ch and ""HDMI out"" (Ver.1.3) supports 2.0ch, 5.1ch and 7.1ch.

Units sold in NTSC regions are SD/ED NTSC, 720p, 1080i and 1080p compliant, while those available  in PAL regions are compatible with SD/ED PAL, 720p, 1080i and 1080p. A NTSC system (480i/480p) cannot output PAL (576i/576p) games and DVDs ([[DVD-Video]]/[[DVD-Audio]]) - however PAL units can display ""All Region"" NTSC DVDs.

'''''Starscream''''' is the name of several [[fictional characters]] in the various series [[Transformers universes]]. This article is primarily about the original character called Starscream. For later ones, see ""[[Starscream (Unicron Trilogy)]]"" and ""[[Starscream (other incarnations)]].""

<!-- This is supposed to be an article on the G1 incarnation. If you feel the changes I've made don't belong, go up to this article's discussion page and explain why. Thank you. -->

==Transformers: Generation 1==
Due to his treachery and personality, Starscream has had many future characters within the franchise to bear his name, most of which share his desire to become leader of the Decepticons. Starscream has, at some points, had control over the [[Decepticon]]s, but his actions usually lead him to being defeated, or overruled by the more powerful Megatron.  Starscream makes no secret of his ambition to overthrow [[Megatron]] as leader of the Decepticons. He is more intelligent than the average Decepticon, ruthless, and cruel, but he is also unlikely to directly act on his ultimate ambition without assurance of conditions favorable to his ascension.  He considers himself vastly superior to other Decepticons, and looks down on Megatron for being antiquated in his military strategy and tactics. Starscream believes that the Decepticons should rely more on guile and speed rather than brute destructive force to defeat the [[Autobot]]s, although when he is given the chance to strike out on his own, he is often less successful than Megatron.  Megatron frequently overlooks the potential threat that Starscream represents, though it is occasionally suggested Megatron tolerates his presence for various reasons, such as a grudging respect for his scheming nature or a mere safety precaution to keep an eye on him. However, Starscream often exhausts Megatron's patience quickly; violent-yet-brief verbal and/or physical conflicts are not uncommon between the two. 

=== Abilities ===
Starscream transforms into a [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle]] and serves as the Decepticon Air Commander, leading the other Decepticon [[Seekers (Transformers)|Seeker]] jets, many of whom share his physical design. According to his technical specifications, he can reach speeds up to [[Mach number|Mach]] 2.8, and can climb up to sub-orbital altitudes of {{convert|52|mi|km|0}} and nose-dive down to ground level in minutes (the real aircraft has a top speed of Mach 2.5 with an altitude ceiling of {{convert|65000|ft|m|-2}}, or 12.3 miles). His arm is mounted with launchers (mounted under his wings in jet mode), which can launch two types of weaponry — [[cluster bomb]]s, each of which can level an area {{convert|10000|sqft|m2|-2}}, and his signature weapon, the null ray, which can disrupt the flow of electricity in any circuitry it hits for brief periods, effectively rendering any electronic device or machine (including Transformers) temporarily inoperable.

=== Marvel Comics ===
Note: Events specific to the Marvel U.K. comic appear in ''italics''. 
Again serving as one of Megatron's elite troops in the attack on the Ark, the [[Marvel Comics]] incarnation of Starscream possessed the desire to take leadership of the Decepticons, but in the early days of the war on [[Earth]], he limited his actions to making snide remarks about Megatron's capabilities, and did not accomplish any notable acts apart from nearly getting scrapped by Megatron after one snide comment too many. When he participated in an attack on the Ark with several of his fellow Decepticons, Starscream was deactivated by [[Omega Supreme]], and sealed in a stasis pod in the ''[[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]]'' for a prolonged period of time.

''At the same time, the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] offices of Marvel Comics were producing their own storylines which were interspliced throughout the U.S. material. Here, writer [[Simon Furman]] portrayed the character's scheming and ambition with more subtlety than the animated series, making Starscream more intelligent and cunning than clownish. He was often the focus of his own stories, including a [[Christmas]] special based around Starscream's misery at being stranded on Earth. In this story and in many others penned by Furman, Starscream often came across as wry and sarcastic. He was one of the most formidable warriors in the Decepticon army and adversaries were often shown to be visibly intimidated by him before he had even begun to fight. At different points in the series, he bests fellow high ranking Decepticons [[Ravage (Transformers)|Ravage]] and [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]] in combat, as well as the Autobot [[Brawn (Transformers)|Brawn]].''

'In the U.K. tales, Starscream was briefly revived from his stasis prison to participate in the events of the ''[[Target: 2006]]'' mega-serial, where he teamed up with future Decepticon leader [[Galvatron]]. Galvatron tolerated his service with amusement, aware of the irony in the situation — Starscream thought that working with Galvatron would ensure his future, but thanks to Galvatron, Starscream had no future, since he was destined to die at his hands in 2006 (in the comic's alternate-future rendition of ''The Transformers: The Movie''). When Autobots from the future duped Galvatron into turning against Starscream, a repainted [[Skywarp]] stood in for Starscream, who Galvatron then blasted. Believing that he had altered his timeline by killing ""Starscream"", Galvatron returned to his future, while the future Autobots returned the true Starscream to stasis.''

In the U.S. stories, Starscream was liberated from his imprisonment by the new Decepticon leader, [[Ratbat]], who appointed him second-in-command of his operations. Starscream would immediately return to form, learning of Ratbat's plan to acquire the power of the [[Underbase]], and orchestrating a massive battle between the Autobot and Decepticon forces that allowed him to seize the colossal information bank's energy. Now imbued with incredible amounts of power, Starscream turned his attention to Earth, and deactivated scores of Transformers who attempted to stand against him. As he steadily mutated into a gigantic being, Starscream was stopped by Optimus Prime, who tricked him into absorbing more of the Underbase's energy — more than his body could handle, destroying him.

''At this point, [[Simon Furman]] began penning the U.S comic book as well as its U.K. counterpart, and quickly returned Starscream to the fold. In the U.K. comics, Megatron had [[Dreadwing|Dreadwind and Darkwing]] locate Starscream's shattered body, only to find that it still possessed some of the Underbase's power, and drained it away using their [[Powermasters|Powermaster]] partners, leaving the body lifeless.'' 

Megatron then had Autobot surgeon [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]] reconstruct Starscream as a [[Pretenders (Transformers)|Pretender]], and had him attack Optimus Prime and [[Scorponok]]'s forces on Earth. Ratchet disobeyed Megatron's request to reprogram his mind, however, and Starscream's original cowardly personality soon re-emerged.

''Issue #248 of the Marvel U.K. Transformers comic featured a story called ""Fallen Star"", where Starscream began to doubt himself, despite being among the most powerful Transformers. [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]], [[Mindwipe (Transformers)|Mindwipe]] and [[Weirdwolf]] feared Starscream would attack, but Starscream thought they were laughing at him behind his back. Leaving, Starscream came across the Autobots [[Chainclaw]], [[Cloudburst (Transformers)|Cloudburst]] and [[Getaway (Transformers)|Getaway]], who were assigned by Optimus Prime to spy on him. Starscream soundly defeated all three Autobots and regained his self-confidence.''

''The U.K. comics then began a breakaway storyline that diverged the continuities, centering around the exploits of the Earthforce, the Earth-based Autobot sub-team. Through a team-up with Soundwave, Starscream succeeded in deposing Megatron and [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]] briefly, before they returned seeking vengeance. Starscream, however, had some unlikely protectors — the Autobots needed him alive so that his compatible systems could boost those of the [[Dinobots|Dinobot]] [[Snarl (Transformers)|Snarl]], who was dying from the rusting disease, Corrodia Gravis.''

''Issue #279 of the Marvel U.K. Transformers comic featured a story called ""Divide and Conquer!"" where Soundwave led the bulk of the Decepticon forces on Earth against the Autobot Earthforce headquarters while Starscream attacked an oil tanker. Sent into battle by Prowl, the Dinobots routed the main Decepticon forces while Springer led the Autobot Survivors, Broadside, Inferno, Skids, and Carnivac to defeat Starscream.''

In the U.S. comics, Starscream went on from his rebirth as a Pretender to join up with [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]] in instigating the Decepticon Civil War, and was transported to Cybertron along with all the other Transformers in preparation for the battle against [[Unicron]]. Following the Transformers' victory, Starscream and Shockwave fled the planet in a restored ''Ark''. On the way the two discovered some unlikely company — Megatron and Ratchet, both restored by [[Nucleon (Transformers)|Nucleon]]. Starscream found Ratchet and prepared to kill him. However, in a fit of rage at Starscream's casual attitude to murder, Ratchet defeated the Decepticon. In order to prevent Megatron and Galvatron escaping to threaten the universe once more, Ratchet crashed the ''Ark'' on Earth.

In ''Generation 2'' Starscream had been deactivated in the crash of the ''Ark'', but Megatron, who had also been on board, was the only survivor and over the next few years restored the Ark, entering into a deal with the human terrorist organization, [[Cobra Organization|Cobra]], which helped him obtain a new body and weapons. Desperate for troops and in spite of his own misgivings about doing so, Megatron then reactivated Starscream (considering his only other choice was Shockwave, Megatron still felt he had made a good decision). Starscream served Megatron with at least a semblance of loyalty, ferrying him to his showdown with [[Bludgeon (Transformers)|Bludgeon]], but when he realized Megatron was going to eliminate him after his new Matrix-created army was functional,  he betrayed him by alerting the forces of the Cybertronian general [[Jhiaxus]] to the location of the joint Autobot/Decepticon base.

Starscream made an appearance in the Decepticon forces under the command of Megatron in issue #7 of the Marvel ''Generation 2'' comic series, in a story called ""New Dawn."" Megatron led his Decepticons against [[Jhiaxus]]' second generation Cybertronians near the moon of Tykos. The Decepticons were defeated and Megatron left injured, presumed dead, but swearing revenge.<ref>{{cite web|author=Seibertron.com |url=http://www.seibertron.com/comics/view.php?comic_id=113 |title=Transformers: Generation 2 #7: ""New Dawn"" |publisher=Seibertron.com |date=1994-05-01 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref>

Starscream was subsequently able to acquire the [[Autobot Matrix of Leadership|Creation Matrix]] (previously stolen from Optimus Prime by Megatron), and used it merge himself with the Decepticon craft, the [[Warworld (Transformers)|Warworld]], turning himself into a living weapon. However, Starscream found his mind affected by the innate goodness of the Matrix, and rejected it in order to preserve his own personality.

''Starscream appeared in his ''Generation 2'' form in the short lived U.K. ''Generation 2'' comic series. This series also printed a bio for Starscream where he had the new motto ""I have a code of conduct — victory at all costs!""''

=== Animated series, first two seasons ===
Starscream (He was named  '''""Скандалист""''' (""Trouble-maker"") in the Russian TV dubbing) was formerly a [[scientist]] and [[Exploration|explorer]], working with the Autobot Skyfire ([[Jetfire]]), during the Golden Age of [[Cybertron]], shortly before the Autobot/Decepticon war re-erupted. Following the disappearance of Skyfire when the two were exploring a prehistoric Earth, Starscream returned to Cybertron and soon abandoned his scientific pursuits, becoming a warrior in Megatron's Decepticon army as the civil war exploded, considering it ""far more exciting"".

Starscream attended the Cybertron War Academy, mentioned in the episode ""A Prime Problem.""

Acting as second-in-command of the elite troops Megatron took with him aboard the ''[[Nemesis (Transformers)|Nemesis]]'', Starscream was among the Transformers trapped in stasis on Earth for four million years after the Decepticons attacked the Autobot craft, [[Ark (Transformers)|''Ark'']], causing it to crash on the planet. When the ship's computer, [[Teletraan I]], was reactivated by a volcanic explosion in 1984, the Decepticons were the first to be reactivated and were restored with new Earthly alternate modes. Before departing, Starscream shot at the Ark as a petty parting gesture, causing a small tremor that knocked [[Optimus Prime]] into the path of the reconstruction beam, allowing the Autobots to be restored, and the war to continue on Earth.

As the war continued, Starscream's old friend Skyfire was discovered frozen in the Arctic Circle, and Megatron noted how concerned Starscream was to see Skyfire rescued; Starscream even took control of the revival process and successfully re-awakened his old friend.  It was this friendship that initially led Skyfire to join the Decepticons, but when the latter refused to hurt humans, both Megatron and Starscream voiced their disgust.  Not long after, several Autobots came to investigate the Decepticon activity and were subsequently captured; Starscream prepared to execute them and Starscream offered to forgive Skyfire if the latter would accept the first shot.  Skyfire, disillusioned by his old friend's new warlike ways, joined the Autobots instead, and Starscream no longer gave him a second thought.

During the cataclysmic events that ensued when Megatron transported Cybertron into Earth's orbit, Starscream attempted to use the Decepticons' human ally, [[Doctor Arkeville]], for his own purposes. Starscream forced him to take him to his secret lab, where he destabilized Arkeville's exponential generator, which, when it reached critical mass, would destroy the Earth. Starscream then fled with Arkeville to Cybertron, where Starscream intended to collect the energy released in Earth's destruction. When Optimus Prime and Megatron were forced to work together to stop Starscream's plan, Starscream returned to Earth to investigate why the generator had not exploded. Meanwhile, to remove the threat of the generator, Prime loaded it into Megatron's gun barrel and fired it into space — blasting Starscream out of the air in the process, causing him to fall to Earth and into a vengeful Megatron's clutches.
 
Starscream was a prominent figure in most of Megatron's schemes over the next year, but also made several further plays for power — teaming up with the [[Triple Changer]]s [[Blitzwing]] and [[Astrotrain]] to betray Megatron, only to be double-crossed himself; duping the paranoiac Autobot, [[Red Alert (Transformers)|Red Alert]] into allowing him to acquire the Autobots' Negavator weapon; incapacitating Megatron's [[Nightbird (Transformers)|Nightbird]] robot to maintain his own position of power; getting drunk on energon, and more. Ironically, given his invariably treacherous nature, he was the first to sniff out Nurgill's treachery when the Decepticons united with the underwater residents of Sub-Atlantica to take over the world, even going as far as saving Megatron from being shot by Nurgill. Generally, almost every time that (the virtually indestructible) Megatron sustained even the slightest damage in a battle, Starscream would claim that Megatron had ""fallen"", and frantically urge the Decepticons to immediately follow himself as their new leader.

Starscream would make use of his old scientist profession in the future, particularly when he and several other Decepticons were temporarily displaced in time to [[medieval]] [[England]]. When the weapons of the time-displaced transformers ceased functioning, Starscream knew how to use available materials to create [[gunpowder]] as a substitute for himself and the other Decepticons. He was also able create an electric [[Electrical generator#Dynamo|dynamo]] to replenish their depleted energy.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/transformers/a-decepticon-raider-in-king-arthurs-court/episode/76001/recap.html ""A Decepticon Raider In King Arthur's Court"" episode synopsis at [[tv.com]] ]</ref>

In 1985, Starscream was responsible for the creation of the [[Combaticons]] by liberating their imprisoned personality components from a detention center on Cybertron and installing them into five [[World War II]] vehicles left over from the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]].  He changed them into more modern vehicular forms (for example, he made Vortex the helicopter out of a crashed World War II fixed-wing aircraft). He intended them to be his own private army after he was exiled from the Decepticons for attempting to betray Megatron one too many times.  Although the Combaticons had defeated Devastator and had Megatron relinquish control of the Decepticons to Starscream using their combined form, [[Bruticus]], they were defeated by an intervening [[Menasor]]. 

Megatron subsequently had Astrotrain relocate Starscream and his giant ally Bruticus to an asteroid in deep space. Finding himself once again in exile, Starscream vowed revenge.

Despite the promises of revenge on Megatron from his creations, Starscream abandoned the Combaticons, blaming them for his failure to take over the Decepticons (where in reality they had helped him succeed). In a mix of cabin fever and boredom, he took his chances venturing into outer space. Ironically, the Combaticons ended up taking control of Cybertron and altered the space bridge to push the Earth into then sun, achieving revenge on Megatron, the Autobots, the Decepticons, and the Earth. Starscream arrived on Cybertron and tried to reclaim his leadership over his creations, but was imprisoned by the Combaticons along with Shockwave.

The Combaticon take over forced another uneasy alliance between the Autobots and Decepticons, who fought Bruticus and ultimately defeated him thanks to a weak spot revealed by Starscream in exchange for Megatron not killing him on the spot.

===Transformers: The Movie===
{{Cleanup-section|date=July 2010}}
Starscream was surprised when [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] said to [[Laserbeak]] ""Unlike some of my other warriors you never fail me"". The Decepticons went into an Autobot shuttle. [[Hook (Transformers)|Hook]], [[Mixmaster]], [[Scrapper (Transformers)|Scrapper]], [[Long Haul]], [[Scavenger (Transformers)|Scavenger]], [[Bonecrusher (Transformers)|Bonecrusher]], [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]], the [[Insecticons]], [[Thundercracker]], [[Dirge (Transformers)|Dirge]] [[Thrust (Transformers)|Thrust]], [[Ramjet (Transformers)|Ramjet]] and other Decepticons came with Megatron and Starscream to the shuttle and [[Autobot City]].

In ""2005"", (the storyline year for the events of the 1986 release ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]''), Starscream finally got his long-awaited chance to dispose of Megatron — who was severely damaged following his final battle with Optimus Prime — by jettisoning him from [[Astrotrain]], into the endless void of deep-space. After this, Starscream won the surviving Decepticons' battle to decide a new leader. Starscream's long-dreamt-of reign did not last long, however — as he was crowning himself leader/king of the Decepticons, [[Galvatron]] arrived, deriding Starscream's coronation as ""bad comedy."" Just as Starscream realized that Galvatron was actually Megatron in a new, more powerful body (provided by [[Unicron]]), Galvatron obliterated him, literally turning Starscream's body to ashes with a single blast while in his cannon mode.

===Later appearances===

Starscream's spark (the core of each Cybertronian that contains their soul/consciousness — referred to as a ""laser core"" in the original animated series) survived, however, apparently confined to the Decepticon crypt on Cybertron, and he continued to exist in a ghost-like form. When the Decepticon turncoat, [[Octane (Transformers)|Octane]], sought refuge from his pursuers in the crypt, Starscream's ghost seized control of [[Cyclonus]]'s body, and worked with Octane to turn Galvatron over to the Autobots and take leadership of the Decepticons for themselves. Galvatron defeated his captors, escaped, and returned to blast Starscream (literally) out of Cyclonus—only for the ghostly Decepticon to quietly take up residence in a [[Sweeps (Transformers)|Sweep]]. A short time later, he possessed Scourge and entered into a bargain with Unicron, performing three labors for the planet-eater in exchange for getting his body back. Acquiring the eyes of [[Metroplex (Transformers)|Metroplex]] and the Transforming Cog of [[Trypticon]], Starscream's body was restored so that he could comprise the final connection between Unicron's head and Cybertron, allowing the planet to become the chaos-bringer's new body.  However, now that he had what he wanted, Starscream reneged on the agreement. At that point, an explosion instigated by the Autobots hurled Starscream and Unicron's head off into space. Starscream was last seen tumbling out of control through space, as Galvatron and the other Decepticons opened fire on him which pushed Starscream far into space.

After the animated series ended in North America, Starscream appeared in animated form in the commercial for the Classic Pretenders.

The precise reason for Starscream's ability to survive after death was never revealed in the original animated series, but would later be covered in ''[[Beast Wars]]''. (see below)

=== Fun Publications ===
Based on the Transformers Classics toy line, the Timelines 2007 story is set 15 years after the end of the Marvel Comics story (ignoring all events of the Marvel U.K. and Generation 2 comics). [[Megatron]] survived the crash of the [[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]] on Earth. He is joined by Starscream, who realized he needed a leader. 

In Transformers: Timelines volume 2 #2, ""Games of Deception"" Megatron detects the arrival of Bugbite's ship on Earth and sends Starscream, Skywarp and Ramjet to investigate. The three Seekers are then taken over by [[Bugbite]]'s cerebro shells (with Starscream swearing to painfully dismember Bugbite for it). When the Autobots eventually jam the shells to facilitate their own rescue of [[Mirage (Transformers)|Mirage]], Starscream is freed and battles Bugbite's faction. Whether he survived the battle is unknown. He seems to retain his usual second-in-command status in this story.

===Beast Wars===
As the 1990s Transformers series, ''[[Beast Wars]],'' officially occurred in a universe/continuity that contained aspects of both of the otiginal animated series ''and'' Marvel comic, the show most commonly displayed its lineage with references to the animated series. To that end, Starscream's ghost made a brief but memorable appearance in the first season episode, ""Possession"". His spark, once again without a body through unknown means, wandered to prehistoric Earth and ended up in the ''[[Darksyde|Darkside]]'''s computer console. Taking control of [[Waspinator]]'s body with [[Terrorsaur]] watching, Starscream went about his standard backstabbing ways, acquiring the trust of Predacon leader [[Megatron (Beast Wars and Beast Machines)|Megatron]], telling him that he was defending [[Galvatron]] against [[Unicron]] and was destroyed, with his [[Spark (Transformers)|spark]] enduring. In reality, he was planning to overthrow Megatron. When his true intent was discovered by [[Blackarachnia]], who knew he was really scrapped by Galvatron for betraying him, Starscream took her under his wing to teach her the ways of treachery —inevitably resulting in her betraying him. Caught in an [[Energon (Power Source)|energon]] explosion engineered by [[Optimus Primal]], Starscream's spark was forced out of Waspinator's body and set adrift in space once more, vowing vengeance on both sides. In the episode, Starscream was voiced by Doug Parker.

In the second season of ''Beast Wars'', the reason for Starscream's ability to survive beyond death was revealed — a [[Mutant (fictional)|mutation]] in his spark had rendered it indestructible. Maximal experiments to replicate this effect resulted in the creation of the insane monster Protoform X, later called [[Rampage (Transformers)#Beast Wars|Rampage]].

Starscream's original body was seen, lying in stasis lock, in the last episode of season two when Megatron entered the ''[[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]]''.

=== Image Comics ===
''Genesis: The Art of Transformers,'' while by no means a primary source of story information, does contain several illustrations of Starscream.  One of them is perhaps the only official illustration of his [[Machine Wars]] form besides the toy's box-art.  Machine Wars Starscream is seen standing on a dais, wearing a purple cape and holding [[Galvatron]]'s torn-off cannon.<ref>[http://www.spektakle.com/portfolio/tf/tf_pro_88mphscream.html Machine Wars Starscream art from ''Genesis''], on [http://spektakle.com the artist's portfolio site.]</ref>  The artist, Matt Kuphaldt, based the setting on the coronation scene from ""[[The Transformers: The Movie]],"" only golden to indicate a post-""Rebirth"" timeframe.  Kuphaldt intended the illustration to be a sequel to his [[fan art|fan-art]] of Starscream's ghost possessing the body of a fallen Decepticon and becoming his Machine Wars self on a similarly-golden battlefield.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spektakle.com/portfolio/tf/tf_fan_starscream.html |title=And the fan-art that preceded the above |publisher=Spektakle.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref>

=== Dreamwave Productions ===
In the 21st century reimagining of the Generation One universe by the comics company [[Dreamwave Productions]], Starscream remained his treacherous, power-hungry self. In the early days of the war on Cybertron, he devastated Iacon with a [[terraforming]] process, and went on to form his own faction called the [[Predacons]] when Megatron vanished in a spacebridge experiment. When the other splinter factions attempted to reconcile their differences, Starscream's Predacons attacked the ceremony, although their bombing occurred concurrently with the return of Megatron, who immediately subjected Starscream to physical torture for stealing his glory.

Winding up in stasis aboard the Autobot spacecraft, the ''Ark'', along with the other Decepticons when it crashed on prehistoric Earth, Starscream was reactivated in 1984 with the other Transformers. When the Autobots succeeded in defeating the Decepticons in 1999 and they all attempted to return to Cybertron aboard the ''Ark II'', the ship exploded as it exited Earth's atmosphere, and the Transformers were believed destroyed. In actuality, many of their bodies were appropriated by the terrorist, Lazarus, including Starscream's. [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], [[Frenzy (Transformers)|Frenzy]], [[Grimlock]], [[Laserbeak]], [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]], [[Ravage (Transformers)|Ravage]], [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]] and Starscream were forced to attack the Smitco oil refinery in the [[Arctic]] to display their power for sale to the highest bidder.<ref>''Transformers: Generation One'' #2</ref> 

When Megatron liberated himself from Lazarus's control in 2002, the other Decepticons were soon freed, and Starscream and the other Decepticon jets passed some time by dismembering the Autobot Mini-Bots before joining in an attack on [[San Francisco]], during which they attacked [[Aerialbots|Superion]], forcing him to separate.

The following year, Starscream was offered the opportunity to return to type when [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]] — who had unified Cybertron in their absence — arrived on Earth to arrest Prime and Megatron as war criminals. Seizing an opportunity to remove his main obstacle to power, Starscream blasted open the cargo hold of the ship taking them back to Cybertron, setting Megatron's damaged body adrift in space.

[[Image:TFG1 4.jpg|right|thumb|Sunstorm faces his brother Starscream]]
With the aid of Soundwave, he subsequently liberated the [[Combaticons]] from imprisonment, and returned with them to Earth, where they attacked the ''Ark'' in an attempt to acquire parts to make the Decepticons' space cruiser flight-worthy. With Bruticus defeated by the arrival of Starscream's Shockwave-spawned, super-powered clone, [[Sunstorm (Transformers)|Sunstorm]], Starscream fled and brought online [[Jetfire]], who the Decepticons had previously uncovered frozen in ice. Operating together, they deduced Sunstorm's [[cloning|clone]] nature, and fashioned a power siphon to drain his energy; but Starscream turned the tables on everyone by freeing Sunstorm, who then took him to a mysterious Cybertronian seal beneath the ocean's surface. Sunstorm claimed that only Starscream could open the seal, which he proceeded to do, unlocking an underground reservoir of a powerful, energy-rich liquid, which Sunstorm planned to use to empower his ""brother,"" so that they could achieve his goals together. Starscream turned on Sunstorm, who fell into the liquid, which reacted with his own powers and destroyed both him and Jetfire.

Starscream escaped the conflagration and returned to the Decepticon base, only to discover that Megatron and Shockwave had returned in his absence, and to receive the beating he had earned from his former leader. Starscream hinted that he had discovered some of the secrets in the Transformers' history that Megatron and Shockwave had learned in the past, but unfortunately, Dreamwave went bankrupt and closed its doors before resolution to this storyline could be offered.

==== Transformers/G.I. Joe ====
Starscream also appeared in Dreamwave's Transformers/[[G.I. Joe]] miniseries, set during [[World War II]], plotting with [[Destro]] to overthrow Megatron and [[Cobra Commander]] using a fusion of [[Cobra Organization|Cobra]] and Decepticon technology called Bruticus. However, he was himself betrayed and destroyed by Destro and the [[Baroness (G.I. Joe)|Baroness]]. In this series, Starscream and the other seekers had alternate modes based on [[P-51 Mustang]]s. He reappeared in a second G.I. Joe/Transformers crossover set in continuity with the first, but over 40 years later. Here, he had his familiar alternate mode of an [[F-15 Eagle]]. His ultimate purpose was left unknown, as Dreamwave's closure meant the series was left unfinished after just one issue.

=== Devil's Due Publishing ===
[[Image:starscream-dd.jpg|right|thumb|Starscream in Devil's Due comics]]
In this crossover from [[Devil's Due Publishing]], the ''Ark'' was discovered by the terrorist Cobra Organization, and all the Transformers inside were reformatted into Cobra vehicles remotely controlled by the Televipers. In this storyline, Starscream turned into a Cobra Nightraven and was used as Cobra Commander's personal transport. Predictably attempting to betray Megatron when the Transformers broke free of Cobra's control, an animosity developed between Starscream and G.I. Joe member [[Snake-Eyes]]. Starscream (controlled by Cobra Commander) was responsible for Snake-Eyes disfigurement in the initial Cobra attack. Snake-Eyes got his revenge when he confronted Starscream in the final issue, cut out Starscream's eye with his sword and shoved a hand-grenade in the empty socket. When the first series ended Starscream ended up making a deal with Cobra Commander to remove the grenade (which hadn't exploded) from his eye socket in return for transport to safety.

The second series from Devil's Due involved a plot by Starscream and Cobra Commander to get technology from Cybertron by breaking into their space bridge system. However, the intervention of both [[Ultra Magnus]]' Autobots and Shockwave's Decepticons complicated this plan, forcing Cobra and G.I. Joe (inadvertently teleported with them) to make a hasty truce to defeat the machinations of Shockwave and recover time-displaced Autobots and Decepticons, including Optimus Prime and the [[Dinobots]]. As Starscream tried to weasel his way out of being destroyed by Shockwave, he was instead eliminated when Cobra Commander activated his parting gift: 45 pounds of [[plastic explosive]]s he had secretly placed in Starscream's housing during repairs.

===Transformers: Robot Masters===
Starscream also appeared in the Japanese exclusive ''[[Transformers: Robot Masters]]'' series. When Megatron disappeared, Starscream quickly seized command, only to be forcibly dethroned by a time-lost newcomer — [[Megatron (Beast Wars and Beast Machines)|the Megatron of the Beast era]]. Plotting all the while behind his new leader's back, Starscream nonetheless served him against the Autobots, battling another time-lost Transformer, [[Star Saber]], and losing, before destroying a large chunk of [[New York City]] to uncover solitarium. He was shot down by the mysterious Reverse Convoy — who quickly revealed himself as Megatron in a new body.

=== IDW Publishing ===
After Dreamwave's closure, the rights to the Transformers comics were taken up by [[IDW Publishing]]. Their version of the Generation One universe begins with a miniseries called ''[[The Transformers: Infiltration]]''. His alternate mode here is that of an [[F-22 Raptor]], foreshadowing the events of the 2007 live action movie.

Chronologically, Starscream first appears in #3 of ''[[The Transformers: Megatron Origin]]'' series, which details the rise of the Decepticons. He is specifically sent to Megatron by Soundwave due to his flight capabilities; pledging complete allegiance, he is sent to launch a terrorist attack on Autobot Senator Decimus. It is later revealed that Megatron has asked him to carry out a task, one Starscream doesn't understand the purpose of but is told it is to ""send a message"". Shortly afterward, the Decepticons are captured by the Autobots. As part of Megatron's plan, Starscream swiftly becomes an Autobot informant. Starscream informs the senators they bear responsibility for the current situation; afterward, he and Soundwave massacre the Senate. After freeing Megatron and the prisoners, Starscream gives Megatron his fusion cannon, helping the Decepticon leader in his battle against [[Sentinel Prime]]. Although his robot mode is different and bears more resemblance to his original G1 incarnation, his alternate jet mode is the same as that seen in ''The War Within''. It was also revealed in ''[[The Transformers: Devastation]]'' that Starscream also spent some time as Megatron's bodyguard.

By the time of ''Infiltration'', Starscream is in command of a small group of Decepticons on Earth, including [[Skywarp]], [[Thundercracker]], [[Astrotrain]], [[Blitzwing]] and the Battlechargers [[Runabout (Transformers)|Runabout]] and [[Runamuck (Transformers)|Runamuck]]. Megatron, as stated in #6, believes the two of them have grown past the backstabbing and posturing of their mutual past. However, on Earth Starscream discovered a variant ore of energon on Earth that was the Transformer equivalent of steroids, making him bold enough to advance their infiltration phase ahead of schedule. As a result, the humans seemingly obtain evidence of the Transformers' existence, causing Starscream to desperately bump off everyone who has seen the evidence. (The evidence-gathering turns out to be a plot by the Machination to locate a Transformer base.<ref>Revealed in previews of ''Devastation'' #1, printed in ''Spotlight: Optimus Prime''</ref>)

Learning of this though, Megatron comes to Earth and duels with Starscream, battling physically and verbally. Even Starscream's supercharged power isn't enough, and Megatron ends the duel with the statement, ""Take your punishment like a Decepticon"" before blowing a hole clean through Starscream's torso with a blast of his arm cannon at point blank range. Despite the immense damage he took, Megatron's commands to Runabout and Runamuck indicate that Starscream had survived. In issue #1 of ''[[The Transformers: Devastation]]'', Megatron's increasing instability forces the other Decepticons, led by [[Astrotrain]], to consider reviving Starscream, who is seen in a stasis tank repaired. He makes his return during the midst of a pitched battle between the Reapers (an army of living weapons) and [[Sixshot]]. Sixshot, upon seeing Starscream, defects to the Reapers, but Starscream takes him out with a shut-off code learned during his time as Megatron's bodyguard. He then attacks the Reapers single-handedly, forcing Megatron to lead the other Decepticons in assisting him. The two managed to put their differences aside, with Starscream stating that he was still loyal to the Decepticon cause, and the Decepticons defeated the Reapers (unknowingly aided by [[Galvatron]]).

G1 Starscream and G1 Pretender Starscream received a cameo on the cover of Spotlight: Galvatron. G1 Starscream, standing with his back towards the reader, can be seen with a hole in his stomach (similar to that in Infiltration) among the creatures that attacked Galvatron. Starscream's Pretender shell can be seen beside him. A Sharkticon can also be seen.

==== Evolutions: Hearts of Steel ====
Starscream is also a major player in the mini-series ''[[The Transformers: Evolutions|Evolutions: Hearts of Steel]]'', which takes place in an out-of-continuity 19th century. Starscream and the other Seekers are reconfigured as [[Wright Brothers]]-esque early aircraft and Starscream plans the familiar concepts of taking over Earth and destroying Megatron. This version of Starscream is less impetuous and has thought his plans through, even using humans to help. Unfortunately his plan was still thwarted by [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] and [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], who were able to redirect the railway so that the Decepticon train convoy was  dropped into a chasm.

=== Kiss Players ===<!-- Please do not remove the heart as Takara recognizes it in their product fine print for the series. -->
The Japanese-exclusive ''[[Transformers (toy line)|Transformers: Kiss Players]]'' toy line features the concept of Transformers who attain power-ups through being kissed by young women, in a universe that branches off from the original animated series. Set in 2006 (one year after Starscream's death in ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'', but four years before the third season of the show, which in Japan occurred in 2010), the ''Kiss Players'' radio drama sees Starscream's ghost possess Earth Defense Command (EDC) operative Atari Hitotonari, and forced her to seek out his old ally, [[Doctor Arkeville]]. Arkeville constructed a new body for Starscream (meant to represent his Masterpiece toy) out of a stolen fighter jet, and Atari transferred his spark into it with a kiss. Transforming into his new robot mode, Starscream was only able to enjoy it for a few minutes before EDC Autotrooper robots blew it up and sent his spark flying back into space.

'''''Big Brother 5''''' in [[2004]] was the fifth season of '''''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]''''' in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], a [[reality television|reality show]] shown on [[Channel 4]] in which a number of contestants live in an isolated house trying to avoid being evicted by the public with the aim of winning a large cash prize at the end of the run.

==Housemates==
===Ahmed Aghil===
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Ahmed.jpg|thumb|left|Ahmed Aghil]]  -->
Ahmed Aghil (born March, [[1960]]) fled to Britain from [[Somalia]] during the early [[1990s]], and is now a successful [[property developer]] and has graduated with a [[academic degree|degree]] in [[law]]. He gained a reputation for his eccentricity and his inexplicable outbursts of violence while in the house. He always remained least favourite to win, with odds ranging from 33/1 to 50/1.

Ahmed usually spent time alone in the garden, or asleep. He was fairly sedate, in sharp contrast to most of the house, meaning that he did not bond with anyone in the house much, and indeed was fairly irritated by many of the housemates.

After a few weeks of participation in the programme, Ahmed began to have spontaneous violent outbursts, in which he threw plates around, chopped the head of a [[papier-mâché]] statue off with a spade and screamed out loud (the first two were in response to the playing into the house of a crying baby, the first time to try to wake the housemates up, the second time to try to get them to talk after they refused to speak for a day in protest at failing a task. He explained his behaviour later on by stating that as a father, he found the sound of a crying baby extremely [[disturbing]]). It eventually became clear that he was under enormous psychological pressure in the house, and that he was becoming increasingly deranged-he recognised this himself, but refused to leave the house of his own accord, since he harboured a dream of having an eviction night and interview like all other evictees (he referred to this as ""his night""). Eventually, it got to the point where he was asking the other housemates to nominate him for eviction. Even when he did so, he was not evicted.

He became somewhat unpopular in the house, with the public turning against him after an incident in the house during a weekly ""Big Brother [[Basic Combat Training|Boot Camp]]"" task, in which he was assigned the role of a [[Private (rank)|private]] (along with 5 other housemates) while two others were assigned the role of [[sergeant]]. He refused to do several activities as required by the task, came to blows with (more popular) sergeant Michelle and eventually tried to instigate a [[military coup]]. In an interview with the [[Daily Mirror]] after the show had finished, he said that his reluctance to take part in the task was due to the memories of the militia in his own country that contributed to his claim for asylum in the UK. Despite this, the group passed the task: however, in accordance with the rules of the task, the privates were immediately up for eviction. He was evicted with 56% of the vote. In his post-eviction interview, he remarked that he did not expect to remain in the house past the third week.
Ahmed recently appeared on [[The Friday Night Project]], and on entering the stage he threw a stack of plates to the ground, smashing them.

===Becki Seddiki===
Becki Seddiki (born [[July 24]], [[1970]]) is a [[singer-songwriter]] from London, with Italian and Moroccan blood. Big Brother told her she must nominate a housemate for eviction, she must kiss the housemate to indicate who she has chosen, this was compulsory.  Her choice of Michelle as recipient of her 'Judas kiss' was hugely unpopular with viewers and resulted in her being evicted at the earliest opportunity.

Since Big Brother, Becki has landed a twice weekly radio DJing slot on a radio station in London (from 2006 onwards) and is still recording her music and performing at several gigs all over the UK.

===Daniel Bryan===
Daniel (born [[January 3]], [[1974]]) is a [[hairdresser]] from [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]. During his stay in the house, Daniel made clear that he was gay due to many conversations about fellow housemate Jason's ""bum"" and many conversations about men.  Dan finished third behind Jason and Nadia. He was an extremely popular contestant on the show and was at one point nicknamed ""Dandalf"" due to his excessive wearing of a grey hooded dressing gown.

===Emma Greenwood===
One of the ''lip gloss bitches'', Emma (born [[October 12]], [[1983]]) was formerly an [[administration|admin]] assistant. She was removed from the house for safety reasons after the notorious ""fight night"" in which she played a leading role. Emma is originally from [[Oldham]], Greater Manchester and had a minor singing career before and after her time in the house. Emma has also been a member of the [[British Army]]

Since leaving the Big Brother house Emma enjoyed her ""moment of fame"" by making various public appearances, as well as appearing along side former Housemate Michelle Bass on the softcore porn channel Television X, performing links between clips during the Freeview.

Emma moved into a flat in London with fellow housemate Marco for several months until ultimately returning to the army.

===Jason Cowan===
Jason Cowan, [[November 1]] [[1973]], in [[Hamilton, South Lanarkshire]]. The runner-up of the series. During the house, he formed a friendship with Victor Ebuwa and Ahmed Aghil that led to the formation of a prominent clique known as the Jungle Cats. Cowan's presence at the end brought a balance to the house after all the villains had left and only friends or people that sat on the fence were left. He spent most of his time laying in bed and bitching about the other housemates with Victor, shaving every conceivable part of his body for lengthy periods of time, and exercising almost constantly.  Happy on entry to the house, Jason became the house villain, he and Nadia hated each other for the second half of the show.  He and Victor also had a strong dislike for the group Victor dubbed ""The Hareem"" consisting of Marco, Michelle, Emma, Nadia and to a lesser extent Stuart.

He was in  Five's recent show ''Commando VIP'', in which he and five other celebrities had to complete SAS-style tasks.

===Kathryn ""Kitten"" Pinder===
Kathryn (""Kat"", or ""Kitten"") Pinder (born [[October 13]], [[1979]]) is a [[human rights|human]] and [[animal rights]] [[activist]]. She entered the house on [[May 28]], [[2004]] and was ejected one week later on [[June 4]] after continuously breaking house rules and receiving three formal warnings. After her ejection, Kitten occasionally appeared on the parallel show ''[[Big Brother's Little Brother]]'', also on Channel 4.

Kitten describes herself as an [[anarchist]], heavily involved in [[political activism]] and opposition to war, the [[class society]] and [[capitalism]]. Before becoming an anarchist, she used to be a member/supporter of the [[Alliance for Workers Liberty]]. She also claimed to be a prostitute in London at the age of 16, although her father denied this in the press, stating that she was in [[boarding school]] in [[Staffordshire]] at the time.  She was also previously a student at the [[University of Hull]]. Kitten moved to [[Australia]] with her [[lesbian]] lover in late 2004 in order to make a fresh start after she claimed to have been shunned by the [[lesbian]] community following her actions whilst in the Big Brother house.

On entering the Big Brother house, Kitten refused to enter until she had seen her girlfriend and made obscene gestures to the crowd and the media. This action led her to be the first housemate to be booed on entry to the house. Her behaviour did not improve once in the house as she refused to obey the rules of Big Brother, leading to three official warnings. 

In an effort to get Kitten to toe the line, Big Brother warned the housemates that they would evict any housemate without warning if Kitten continued to break the rules. However Kitten again broke the rules by daubing anti-war slogans on the wall of the house. On the second week, live on Channel 4, Kitten was finally ejected from the house for her persistent rule-breaking, initially refusing to leave. She was eventually removed from the house after ''Big Brother'' began reducing the £100,000 prize fund by £1,000 for every 6 seconds she stayed in the house. On leaving Kitten shouted at the media against the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]] and the [[Aristocracy]].

Some days later she appeared in court regarding her non-payment of parking fines amounting to £225. She blamed it on [[Tony Blair]]'s education policy, saying she could not pay the fines because of student debts.

===Marco Sabba===
Marco Jaye Sabba (born [[April 20]], [[1983]]) was a [[law student]] from [[Kingston University]], and was particularly friendly with [[Nadia Almada]],Emma Greenwood and Michelle Bass. The quartet called themselves the 'lip gloss bitches', but were dubbed Marco's harem by Victor. Also, he hilariously tripped his own mother by sliding along a slippery stage when he emerged from the Big Brother house. Marco has appeared in a West End stage show and reappeared on British Television since leaving the Big Brother house. He, along with fellow housemate Emma, provided a commentary of ''[[Celebrity Big Brother UK]]'' on ''[[Richard and Judy]]''.

===Michelle Bass===
{{seealso|Michelle Bass}}
Michelle Bass (born [[February 2]], [[1981]] in [[Newcastle Upon Tyne|Newcastle]]) was formerly a [[mortgage advisor]]. She was a member of the 'Lip gloss Bitches', along with Marco Sabba, Emma Greenwood and [[Nadia Almada]]. She was best known for her the spell in the bedsit with Emma Greenwood, as well as her relationship with Stuart Wilson - they allegedly became the first couple to have sex live on British television after Michelle fashioned a ""fort"" from a table, chairs and table cloth so that they could have some privacy from the cameras. Michelle was referred to as a ""bunny boiler"" by the press due to her obsessive pursuit of Stuart. She also referred to most people by the pet-name ""chicken"" which became a popular catchphrase during her time in the house. Michelle and Stuart remained a couple for some time following [[Big Brother]], but eventually split up. She has since featured on [[Television X]], performing links between clips during the Freeview and has participated in phootshoot with the British men's magazine; Nuts. Michelle had previously admitted to being a fan of [[pornography]] in her [[Big Brother]] audition.

===Michelle ""Shell"" Jubin===
Shell, (originally from [[Hampshire]], later moved to [[Selkirk]] before attending University), was a former [[History of Art]] [[student]] and lived in [[Glasgow]] where she still has a home. She was most famous for stripping and mowing the lawn naked. Soon after the series ended she appeared alongside Vanessa appearing in raunchy photo shoots.  She has since returned to higher education studying for a masters degree in Art History.  She has been a contributor to BBC Radio Scotland and works with The Look Agency in Glasgow.   In 2006 Shell moved to [[New York]] in order to work at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]].

===Nadia Almada===
{{seealso|Nadia Almada}}
'''Nadia Almada''' (born [[January 28]], [[1977]]) was born on the Portuguese Island of [[Madeira]], under the name of Jorge, but she was known as Carlos. She moved to [[England]] in [[1996]] and worked in a [[department store]] in [[Woking]], where she lives. She has also managed a children's book store. Before entering the Big Brother house she worked as a cashier in a well-known bank.

[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]] dubbed Nadia the Portugeezer, the ""Portuguese Man O' War"" and NADS, NADS being a [[slang]] term for [[gonads]] ([[testicles]]) <ref> [http://www.pfc.org.uk/gendrpol/pcc-doss.pdf Transsexual people and the press - collected opinions from transsexual people themselves (PDF) (see section B.5.j)]</ref>. 

She became the first [[transwoman]] in the Big Brother house, competing in the 2004 series in the UK. After 71 days in the house she emerged as the winner, securing 74% of the overall vote and winning £63,500.

===Stuart Wilson===
Stuart Wilson (born [[April 28]] [[1984]]) is a [[student]] from [[Macclesfield]]. He was initially a member of the jungle cats, although when things got serious with Michelle, he was neither here nor there. He was best known in the house for his relationship with Michelle and for his constant need to dress up and child-like personality. He claimed to be the most intelligent contestant ever to appear on Big Brother.

During one task, Stuart was given a cowboy outfit which he fell in love with; particularly with the hat. After eventually giving it back to Big Brother, he asked for it back again. They gave him an oversized one instead, and then a miniature one. Later on, when the contestants refused to co-operate with Big Brother, they put the TVs on and showed them burning the original hat, much to the distress of Stuart. Throughout all this, up until the burning, ''Big Brother's Little Brother'' held a campaign for Stuart to get his hat back. Soon after Stuart's eviction, Michelle bought him a cowboy hat.

Michelle and Stuart enjoyed a year long relationship, in which they attended showbiz parties and covered many articles in glossy magazines. Soon after the [[Big Brother UK series 6|sixth series]] of ''Big Brother'' started, it was revealed these two had split up.

Stuarts time in the house was a quiet one, he didn't speak much (other than to Michelle).  This was reflected in his votes, he was not nominated once during his time in the house but in the final he received the least number of votes (votes to win), no one liked him, no one disliked him.  His eviction was a surprise, days before the final Big Brother asked him into the diary room and told him to leave the house

===Vanessa Nimmo===
Vanessa Nimmo (born [[12 August]] [[1977]]) is a former double South African archery champion.  She was born in [[Cape Town]] but moved to [[Leeds]] in 1994. After being on Big Brother, she dated [[Ben Fogle]] for a few months.[http://showbiz.sky.com/showbiz/article/0,,50001-1167235,00.html] During ""Fight Night"", it took half of the housemates to hold Nadia back after Vanessa had supposedly slapped her. Like Michelle Bass, Vanessa also had breast implants which prompted her to do raunchy photo shoots with fellow housemate Shell Jubin.

===Victor Ebuwa===
Victor Ebuwa (born [[January 17]], [[1981]]), from [[London]], was the co-Leader of the 'Jungle Cats', styling himself as 'Slick (Vic)' in the house, and formed a close partnership with Jason Cowan, and also with Ahmed Aghil. He was known for his memorable [[one-liner]]s and [[rapping|rap]]/[[-izzle]]-style speech, for speaking his mind and having a game plan. He is also probably the first housemate ever to openly discuss his plan in the Diary Room in the house.

On day 57 he was evicted following an argument with fellow housemate Shell Jubin, after which a fan of Victor's sent death threats to Shell's parents house. Previous to this argument Victor was second favourite to win the show.

Many TV critics, including Ally Ross (''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' TV Critic), have credited Victor for saving the ''Big Brother'' UK franchise, thanks to stirring controversy and his 'straight talking' attitude towards housemates.  The previous year's show was slammed by critics for being dull, leading to record low viewing figures and a subsequent drop in eviction votes. Viewing figures increased this year to an average of 7 million every night.

Since leaving the house, Victor has appeared on [[Celebrity Poker Club]] as well as various other channel 4 shows.

==Chronology==
Trailed as ""Big Brother turns evil"", it was controversial from the start. The house was smaller and more claustrophobic; there was one bedroom; and the prize money of £100,000 was reduced if housemates failed their tasks. Big Brother promised tougher challenges as well as surprises to test the minds of housemates.  The makers were initially criticised for choosing contestants specifically to boost ratings, opting for people that were openly gay (Marco, Dan and Kitten), a [[transsexual]] ([[Nadia Almada|Nadia]]), a former [[asylum seeker]] (Ahmed), and a person who claimed to be bisexual (Jason, although he later revealed that this had been a fabrication to improve his chances of being selected).  This feeling soon dissipated to a large extent as the personalities of the housemates overshadowed these issues.

===Week 1===
The housemates were all strong, opinionated characters. On Day 2, the housemates was to decide who was least deserving of their suitcase; they chose Kitten. On Day 5, the rebellious housemates decided to move the refrigerator the bedroom, but the housemates (especially Kitten) were disciplined for their actions.<ref>[http://bigbrother.digitalspy.co.uk/article/ds6201.html Damage Limitation]</ref> However, some housemates such as Victor, did not respond well to the task. On Day 6, Emma and Kitten discovered a room; this turned out to be the Big Brother Bedsit.<ref>[http://bigbrother.digitalspy.co.uk/article/ds6219.html Housemates discover secret room]</ref> On Day 8, Kitten was ejected in the first week for constant rule-breaking. In Big Brother's first example of evil towards the housemates during the programme, £1,000 was deducted for every minute Kitten remained in the house. Therefore, there was no eviction in Week 1. At the end of Week 1, the housemates had £91,000 left in the prize fund.

===Week 2===
Another task was introduced, which could have potentially made the housemates lose £10,000, involved Stuart's knowledge and Jason's strength. Stuart was required to answer general knowledge questions in the Diary Room while Jason had to spin a turntable on which the rest of the housemates sat. The housemates lost £5,000 during the task. In an interesting twist, Big Brother decided that Ahmend has not abided by the task rules and therefore another £1,000 was lost. At this point, the total was £85,000. On Day 10, the housemates were told of the first week-long task: Big Brother Food to Go, a 24/7 fast food challenge. The housemates failed the task. A fake eviction on Day 15 saw two of the housemates, Emma and Michelle, confined to the nearby ""Big Brother [[Bedsit]]"" where they could see and hear what was happening in the house without the others knowing. This was originally supposed to happen on Day 8, but Kitten's eviction postponed it.

===Week 3=== 
After Emma and Michelle's return to the house, scenes of aggression and violence erupted resulting in on-site security staff having to enter the house for the first time in the show's history. Some viewers of the live feed also called the police; after a short investigation, a joint statement by Hertfordshire [[British Police|police]] and producers Endemol said that they were satisfied with steps being taken to ensure housemates' safety and well-being. Police were also reportedly questioning each contestant as they left the house. Emma was moved back to the bed-sit and later evicted permanently. Several remaining housemates (Victor, Jason, Nadia, Vanessa, Marco) were given a formal warning. A psychologist on the show resigned, claiming that his warnings that Endemol's deliberate selection of housemates likely to cause conflict would lead to the fight went unheeded. Although the fight was quite destructive, almost seven million people watched the daily highlight show including the fight.<ref>[http://bigbrother.digitalspy.co.uk/article/ds6572.html Over 7m tune into the fight] ''Digital Spy''</ref> The eviction originally planned on Day 22 was held off until Day 29.

Following the fight the arguments continued, but nothing on the scale of what producers refer to as ""Day 20"" or ""Fight Night"".  Following an appearance on [[MTV UK|MTV]]'s ''[[Total Request Live]]'' Emma and Victor clashed again and had to be separated by the security on the show.

===Week 4===
As a result of the fighting on Day 20, Emma was ejected from the Big Brother House on Day 23. The housemates were given a paper-maché task on Day 25, which was to create a unique housemate sculpture. The sculpture was later torn down my Ahmed. On Day 29, Vanessa was evicted. It was also revealed that the live task show would be dropped from the television schedule so that another daily highlight show could be watched in its place.

===Week 5===
On Day 30, Big Brother gave the housemates another task that risked their prize fund. Before the challenge started, the housemates had £77,000, having lost £23,000 during their stay so far. Their task dealt with unscrambling the other housemates and resisting an electric shock. The contestants lost a total of £3,000 in the task, lowering the maximum prize to £74,000.<ref>[http://bigbrother.digitalspy.co.uk/article/ds6686.html Housemates lose another £3,000 in task]</ref> Since the rules stipulate that a replacement housemate may be added in lieu of a walkout or ejection, a surprise new housemate, Becki Seddiki, entered the house on Day 31 as Emma's replacement. She was immediately given a task by Big Brother to (based on first impressions) kiss one of the housemates and that housemate would be up for eviction. This became known as the ""[[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] kiss"". She chose popular housemate Michelle, leading to her being perceived by many as a traitor, and her fate was sealed. Marco was evicted on Day 36.

===Week 6===
On Day 40,  a major row broke out between Michelle and Becki when Michelle saw a plane flying over the garden with the message, ""The Sun - Only Becki nominated Michelle.""<ref>[http://bigbrother.digitalspy.co.uk/article/ds6848.html Michelle discovers the truth]</ref> On Day 42, the housemates participated in a silent protest against Big Brother. Michelle decided to steal the Diary Room camera and attempted to incinerate it using a match. Because the camera base is fireproof, this did not work. As punishment for this, Michelle was given her ""first and final warning"" and Big Brother burnt Stuart's cowboy hat, as Stuart sat behind the sofa in horror. Becki was evicted on Day 43 because of her unpopularity by kissing Michelle and therefore nominating her.

===Week 7===
Big Brother gave the housemates a boot camp task. Jason and Michelle were selected as sargeants while the rest of the housemates were privates. In the Diary Room, Jason and Michelle were told that if the privates passed the task, then they would be up for eviction, and if the privates failed the task, then the two sargeants would be nominated. The privates passed, and all six were automatically nominated for eviction. On Day 48, the housemates participated in a dating service. Ahmed badly upset Michelle during the boot camp task and this was not well received by the public; he was evicted on Day 50.

===Week 8===
The following week the flamboyant, aggressive Victor Ebuwa was evicted in a shock result that was mainly a result of a fight with Shell Jubin during a Wedding Day task. This task was also the scene for one of the most embarrassing Big Brother moments of recent times as wannabe-singer and chorister for the day, Michelle Bass, ad-libbed her way through the classical ''Pie Jesu''. The housemates failed the task. Victor was evicted on Day 57.

===Week 9===
The following week Michelle was evicted. The series was notable for her romance with Stuart Wilson. It is widely believed that they were the first couple to have full penetrative sex on the main ''Big Brother'' UK show (this having already taken place on ''Teen Big Brother'' in 2003), following two incidents where they made a crude tent under the dining table and discarded their microphones. However their actions were not visible, and both parties have refused to confirm or deny it. Michelle's self-confessed jealous behaviour gave some viewers the impression that Stuart was an unwilling participant in the affair, but he has stated since that this was not the case. The relationship continued after both had left the house. They have since split up.

===Week 10===
Two days before the final day Stuart Wilson received only 7% of the votes to win, the lowest amount of the contestants in the house, and so was evicted in a surprise move mid-way through a party.  He was told he was to leave immediately, without saying goodbye to the remaining housemates.  He received a rapturous reception upon leaving the Big Brother house.

Nadia, as expected by all the [[bookmaker]]s (she was favourite for six weeks) won Big Brother (UK) 2004 with 74% of the vote.  She was greeted by an adoring crowd who chanted her name.

BB5 was also notable for the introduction by two of the housemates of the 'eviction pose', which led to several evictees doing poses during ''[[Big Brother UK series 6|Big Brother 6]]''. First Victor struck a 'cool' pose in keeping with his house 'gangsta' persona, leaning against the wall sideways on to the waiting audience. Later Dan (who could possibly have seen Victor before the inner doors closed) stood, head bowed, arms out, before lifting his head.

Final vote breakdown:
#Nadia: 3,863,696
#Jason: 1,335,246
#Dan: 685,995
#Shell: 347,051
''Total number of votes in the final week: 6.3 million''

==Prize Fund==
[[Image:BB5UKPrizeFund.png|250px|thumb|The Big Brother 5 prize fund]]
One of the central twists to Big Brother in 2004 was the fluctuating prize fund. Housemates could either win or lose money depending on how well they completed the task. As the winner, Nadia received £63,500, meaning that the housemates lost £36,500 during the 71 day run of the programme.

===Week 1===
The housemates lost £9,000 during week one. Kitten was ejected from the Big Brother house, but she refused to leave. Big Brother decided to drop £1,000 from the prize fund for every minute that Kitten remained in the house. She stayed inside the house for nine minutes and the housemates lost £9,000. At the end of week one, the prize was £91,000.

===Week 2===
During the weekly task, the housemates lost £6,000. The total after week two was £85,000.

==Jungle Cats==
'''Jungle Cats''', also referred to as the JCs, were the clique that were prominent in the reality show [[Big Brother UK series 5]]. The group consisted of a trio who were Ahmed Aghil, Jason Cowan and Victor Ebuwa. Stuart Wilson was also initially part of the Jungle Cats, yet became more of a jungle kitten than a jungle cat as his relationship with Michelle Bass developed whilst in the house. They earned a loyal fan base of around 1.2 million of the average 7 million who watched the series. They were seen as the masculine peoples favourite clique as opposed to the feminine peoples clique represented by the Jungle Cats rivals the Lip Gloss Bitches who were founded by [[Marco Sabba]]. In the show Ahmed Aghil lasted 7 Weeks followed by [[Victor Ebuwa]] who lasted 8 weeks. [[Jason Cowan]] the founder of the Jungle Cats finished the show as Runner up in a programme seen by the JCS and by leading TV critic Ally Ross {{Fact|date=February 2007}}, of the sun as biased in favour of [[Nadia Almada]] who eventually won the show.

== Notes ==
{{fnb|1}} In week 1, housemates had to nominate who they didn't want to receive their suitcase, not who they wanted to evict. Kitten refused to nominate. Kitten was ejected after constant rule breaking.

{{fnb|2}} This week, housemates were told there was a double eviction, and the two housemates to be evicted were Emma and Michelle. In actuality, the public had been voting which two housemates enter a secret Big Brother Bedsit, in which the two evictees would live for five days, and be able to watch their fellow housemates on a television screen, and then return to the house, still able to win the prize money. 

{{fnb|3}} Emma and Michelle made their nominations from the Bedsit. The other housemates could not nominate them, assuming them to be evicted.

{{fnb|4}} Due to Emma’s ejection from the house, Week Three’s eviction was postponed until Week Four.

{{fnb|5}} In Week Five, new housemate Becki arrived. She could not be nominated, and believed she could not nominate. However, Big Brother told her that she must nominate one housemate who will automatically face eviction by kissing them. If she didn’t do this, she would be up for eviction. Becki kissed Michelle, meaning she was up against the two housemates with the most nominations, Marco and Nadia.

{{fnb|6}} Jason and Victor were banned from nominating due to constant discussion of nominations

{{fnb|7}} In the housemates army task, sergeants Jason and Michelle were told of the twist in nominations. If the privates passed the task, all six privates would face eviction. If the privates failed, sergeants would face eviction. Privates passed, meaning the six of them faced eviction.

{{fnb|8}} All housemates faced eviction automatically.

{{fnb|9}} There were no nominations in the final week. With five housemates remaining, the housemate with the least public votes to win would be evicted in a surprise eviction during a party. Stuart was this housemate, leaving Dan, Jason, Nadia and Shell in the final four.

'''Joel Chandler Harris''' (December 9, 1845&nbsp;– July 3, 1908) was an American [[journalist]], fiction writer, and folklorist best known for his collection of [[Uncle Remus]] stories.  Harris was born in [[Eatonton, Georgia|Eatonton]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], where he served as an apprentice on a plantation during his teenage years.  He spent the majority of his adult life in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] working as an associate editor at the ''[[Atlanta Constitution]]''.

Harris led two significant professional lives.  Editor and journalist Joe Harris ushered in the [[New South]] alongside [[Henry W. Grady]], stressing regional and racial reconciliation during and after the [[Reconstruction era]].  Joel Chandler Harris, fiction writer and folklorist, recorded many [[Brer Rabbit]] stories from the African-American oral tradition and revolutionized children's literature in the process.<ref name=""goldthwaite"">{{cite book | last = Goldthwaite | first = John | title = The Natural History of Make-Believe: A Guide to the Principal Works of Britain, Europe, and America | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1996 | isbn = 0195038061 }}</ref>

Controversy surrounding his southern plantation themes, narrative structure, collection of African-American folklore, use of dialect, and [[Uncle Remus]] character, however, has denigrated the significance of Harris' work, especially during the latter half of the [[20th century]].

== Life ==
=== Eatonton: 1845 - 1862 ===
Joel Chandler Harris was born in Eatonton, Georgia in 1845 to Mary Ann Harris.  His father, whose identity remains unknown, abandoned his family shortly after Harris was born.  The parents had never married, so Harris took the name Joel from his attending physician, Dr. Joel Branham.  Chandler was the name of his mother's uncle.<ref name=""brasch"">{{cite book | last = Brasch | first = Walter | title = The Cornfield Journalist | publisher = Mercer University Press | year = 2000 | isbn = 0865546967 }}</ref>  Harris remained self-conscious of his illegitimate birth throughout his life.<ref name=""bryson"">{{cite book | last = Bryson | first = Bill | title = Mother Tongue: English and How It Got that Way | publisher = Harper Perennial | year = 1991 | isbn = 0380715430 }}</ref>

A prominent physician, Dr. Andrew Reid, gave the Harris family a small cottage behind his mansion.  Mary Harris worked as a seamstress and helped neighbors with their gardening to support herself and her son.  She was an avid reader and instilled her son with a love of language: ""My desire to write--to give expression to my thoughts--grew out of hearing my mother read ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]''."" <ref>Harris, Joel Chandler.  ""The Accidental Author"" ''Lippencot's Magazine'', April 1886. p. 418.</ref>

Dr. Reid also paid for Harris' school tuition for several years.  In 1856, Joe Harris briefly attended Kate Davidson's School for Boys and Girls, but transferred to Eatonton School for Boys later that year following an undistinguished academic record and a habit of truancy.  Harris excelled in reading and writing, but was mostly known for his pranks, mischief, and sense of humor.  Practical jokes helped Harris cloak his innate shyness and insecurities about his red hair, Irish ancestry, and illegitimacy, leading to both trouble and a reputation as a leader among the older boys.<ref name=""bickley"">{{cite book | last = Bickley | first = Bruce | title = Joel Chandler Harris: a Biography and Critical Study | publisher = University of Georgia Press | year = 1987 | isbn = 0820331856 }}</ref>

=== Turnwold Plantation: 1862 - 1866 ===
Harris quit school early to help alleviate the financial burden on his mother.  In March 1862, Joseph Addison Turner, owner of Turnwold Plantation nine miles east of Eatonton, hired Harris to work as a [[printer's devil]] for his newspaper ''The Countryman''.  Harris worked for clothing, room, and board.  The newspaper reached subscribers throughout [[the Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and became one of the larger newspapers in the South with a circulation of about 2,000.  Harris learned to set type for the paper, and Turner allowed him to publish his own poems, book reviews, and humorous paragraphs.

Turner's instruction and technical expertise exerted a profound influence on Harris.  During his four year tenure at Turnwold Plantation, Joe Harris consumed the literature in Turner's library.  He had access to the works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], and [[Sir Thomas Browne]], as well as to ''[[Arabian Nights]]'', [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[John Milton|Milton]], [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]], [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]], and [[Edgar Allan Poe]].  Turner, a fiercely independent Southern loyalist and eccentric intellectual, emphasized the work of southern writers, yet stressed that Harris read widely.  In ''The Countryman'' Turner insisted that Harris not shy away from including humor in his journalism.<ref name=""bickley""/>

While at Turnwold Plantation, Harris spent hundreds of hours in the slave quarters during time off.  Much of his self-consciousness disappeared in the slave quarters, and his humble background as an illegitimate, red-headed son of an Irish immigrant helped foster an intimate connection with the slaves.  He absorbed the stories, language, and inflections of people like Uncle George Terrell, Old Harbert, and Aunt Crissy.<ref>[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-525&hl=y ""Joel Chandler Harris""]</ref>  The African-American animal tales they shared later became the foundation and inspiration for Harris' [[Uncle Remus]] tales.  George Terrell and Old Harbert in particular became models for Uncle Remus as well as role models for Harris.

=== Savannah and the South: 1866 - 1876 ===
Joseph Addison Turner shut down ''The Countryman'' in May 1866.  Joe Harris left the plantation with useless [[Confederate States of America dollar|Confederate money]] and very few possessions.

''[[The Macon Telegraph]]'' hired Harris as a typesetter later that year.  Harris found the work unsatisfactory and himself the butt of jokes around the office, in no small part due to his red hair.  Within five months, he accepted a job working for the ''New Orleans Crescent Monthly'', a literary journal.  Just six months after that, homesick, he returned to Georgia, but with another opportunity at the ''Monroe Advertiser'', a weekly paper published in [[Forsyth, Georgia]].

At the ''Advertiser'' Harris found a regional audience with his column ""Affairs of Georgia."" Newspapers across the state reprinted his humorous paragraphs and political barbs.  Harris' reputation earned him the position of associate editor at the ''[[Savannah Morning News]]'', the largest circulation newspaper in Georgia.   Though he relished in his position in Forsyth, Joe Harris accepted the $40-a-week job, a significant pay increase, and quickly established himself as Georgia's leading humor columnist while at the ''Morning News''.

In 1872 Harris met Mary Esther LaRose, a seventeen year-old French-Canadian from Quebec.  After a year of courtship, Harris and LaRose married in April 1873.  LaRose was 18 and Harris, 27 (though publicly admitting to 24).  Over the next three years, the couple had two children.  Their life in Savannah came to an abrupt halt, however, when they fled to Atlanta to avoid a [[yellow fever]] epidemic.<ref>Brasch, p. 23 - 33.</ref>

=== Atlanta: 1876 - 1908 ===
In 1876 Harris accepted a position from [[Henry W. Grady]] at the ''[[Atlanta Constitution]]'', where he would remain for the next 24 years, most of that time in association with other writers including [[Frank Lebby Stanton]] who was in turn an associate of [[James Whitcomb Riley]].<ref>Stanton joined the ''Atlanta Constitution'' in 1889, having been recruited by Harris and Grady.</ref>  Not long after taking the job, Harris began the Uncle Remus stories as a serial to ""preserve in permanent shape those curious mementoes of a period that will no doubt be sadly misrepresented by historians of the future."" <ref name=""Bickley, 38"">Bickley, 38</ref>  The tales were reprinted across the United States, and Harris was approached by publisher [[D. Appleton and Company]] to compile them for a book.

''[[Uncle Remus: His Songs and His Sayings]]'' debuted near the end of 1880.  Hundreds of newspapers reviewed the best-seller, and Harris found himself in the national spotlight, albeit reluctantly.  Of the press and attention [[Walter Hines Page]] noted,  ""Joe Harris does not appreciate Joel Chandler Harris.""<ref>Page, Walter Hines. ""The New South."" ''Boston Post,'' September 28, 1881</ref>
[[Image:Wrens nest joel chandler harris home.JPG|thumb|right|[[Joel Chandler Harris House|The Wren's Nest]]]]
Royalties from the book were modest, but allowed Harris to rent a six-room house in [[West End (Atlanta)|West End]], an unicorporated village on the outskirts of Atlanta, to accommodate his growing family.  Two years later Harris bought the house and hired architect George Humphries to transform the farmhouse into a [[Queen Anne style|Queen Anne Victorian]] in the Eastlake style.  The home, soon thereafter called [[Joel Chandler Harris House|The Wren's Nest]], would be where Harris spent most of his time.

Harris preferred to write at the Wren's Nest, and would often take the mule-drawn trolley to work, pick up his assignments, and bring them back home.  Not only was Harris writing for the ''Constitution'' and compiling more stories for ''[[Nights with Uncle Remus]]'' (1883), but he also contributed local-color stories  to magazines like ''[[Scribner’s Monthly|Scribner's]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'',and  ''[[Century Magazine|The Century]]''.<ref name=""Bickley, 38""/>

Harris published prodigiously throughout the 1880s and 1890s, trying his hand at novels, children's literature, and even a translation of French folklore.  Yet he rarely strayed from home and work during this time, choosing to remain close to his family and his gardening.  Harris and his wife Essie had six more children in Atlanta, with a total of six (out of nine) surviving past childhood.  The oldest, [[Julian LaRose Harris]], won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] with his wife [[Julia Collier Harris]] in 1926, in part for their ""energetic fight"" against the Ku Klux Klan.<ref>http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1926</ref>

By the late 1890s, Harris tired of the newspaper grind and suffered from health problems most likely stemming from alcoholism.  At the same time, he grew more comfortable with his creative persona.  Harris retired from the ''Constitution'' in 1900, yet continued experimenting with novels and writing articles for outlets like ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''.  Still, he remained close to home, refusing to accept honorary degrees from the University of Pennsylvania and Emory College.  In 1905 Harris was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]].

Harris did travel to accept an invitation to the White House by [[Theodore Roosevelt|President Theodore Roosevelt]].  Two years earlier, Roosevelt had said, ""Presidents may come and presidents may go, but Uncle Remus stays put.  Georgia has done a great many things for the Union, but she has never done more than when she gave Mr. Joel Chandler Harris to American literature.""<ref>Bickley, 59.</ref>

On July 3, 1908, Joel Chandler Harris died of acute nephritis and complications from cirrhosis of the liver.  In his obituary, the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' echoed Roosevelt's sentiment, stating: “Uncle Remus cannot die.  Joel Chandler Harris has departed this life at the age of 60 [...] but his best creation, [Uncle Remus] with his fund of folk-lore, will live in literature."" <ref>""Uncle Remus.""  Saturday Review of Books, ''The New York Times.''  11 July 1908.</ref>

== Writing ==
=== Folklore ===
Harris created the first iteration of the Uncle Remus character for the ''[[Atlanta Constitution]]'' in 1876 after inheriting a column written by [[Samuel W. Small]], a colleague who had taken leave from the paper.   In these character sketches Remus would visit the newspaper office to discuss the social and racial issues of the day.  By 1877 Small had returned to the ''Constitution'' and resumed his column.

Harris had no intention to continue the Remus character.  But when Small once again left the paper, Harris reprised Remus and this time realized the literary value of the stories of his youth from the slaves of Turnwold Plantation.  Harris sought out to record the stories and insisted that they be verified by two independent sources before he would set them into print.  The pursuit proved more and more difficult given his professional duties, urban location, race and, eventually, fame.<ref>Bickley, Bruce (2003) Introduction to ''Nights with Uncle Remus''.  Penguin Books.</ref>

On July 20, 1879, Harris published ""The Story of Mr. Rabbit and Mr. Fox as Told by Uncle Remus"" in the ''Atlanta Constitution.''  It was the first of 34 plantation fables that would comprise ''Uncle Remus: His Songs and His Sayings'' in 1880.  The stories, mostly collected directly from the African-American [[Oral literature|oral storytelling tradition]], were revolutionary in their use of dialect, animal personage, and serialized landscape.<ref>Goldthwaite, 254 -257</ref>

[[Image:Brer Rabbit and the Tar Baby.jpg|thumb|right|[[Br'er_Rabbit|Brer Rabbit and the Tar-Baby]]]]

Remus' stories featured a [[trickster]] [[hero]] called [[Br'er Rabbit]] (""Brother"" Rabbit), who used his wits against adversity, though his efforts did not always succeed. Br'er Rabbit is a direct interpretation of [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba tales]] of Hare, though some others posit Native American influences as well.<ref> That the People Might Live : Native American Literatures and Native American Community, p. 4</ref><ref>[http://www.godchecker.com/pantheon/african-mythology.php?deity=HARE Hare: Infamous Trickster God]</ref>  Scholar Stella Brewer Brookes asserts, ""Never has the trickster been better exemplified than in the Br'er Rabbit of Harris.""<ref>Brookes, Stella Brewer (1950).  ''Joel Chandler Harris: Folklorist''.  University of Georgia Press, 63.</ref>  Br'er Rabbit was accompanied by friends and enemies alike, such as Br'er Fox, Br'er Bear, Br'er Terrapin, and Br'er Wolf.  The stories represented a significant break from the romantic [[fairy tale]]s of the Western tradition: instead of a singular event in a singular story, the critters on the plantation existed in an ongoing community saga, time immemorial.<ref>Goldthwaite, 282</ref>

The Uncle Remus stories garnered critical acclaim and achieved popular success well into the 20th century.  Harris compiled eight books of Uncle Remus stories, including ''[[Uncle Remus: His Songs and His Sayings]]'' (1880), ''[[Nights with Uncle Remus]]'' (1883),  and ''[[Told by Uncle Remus: New Stories of the Old Plantation]]'' (1905).  The tales, 185 in sum,  became immensely popular among both black and white readers in the North and South.  Few outside of the South had ever heard accents like those spoken in the tales, and no one had ever seen the dialect legitimately and faithfully recorded in print.  To the North and those abroad, the stories were a ""revelation of the unknown.""<ref>Brookes, 43</ref>  [[Mark Twain]] noted in 1883, ""in the matter of writing [the African-American dialect], he is the only master the country has produced."" <ref>Twain, Mark.  ''Life on the Mississippi.'' Dover, 2000.  p. 210.  ISBN 0-486-41426-4</ref>

The stories introduced international readers to the American South.  [[Rudyard Kipling]] wrote in a letter to Harris that the tales ""ran like wild fire through an  English Public school.... [We] found ourselves quoting whole pages of Uncle Remus that had got mixed in with the fabric of the old school life.""<ref>Kipling, Rudyard.  Letter to Joel Chandler Harris, 6 December 1895</ref>  The Uncle Remus tales have since been translated into more than forty languages.

[[James Weldon Johnson]] called the collection ""the greatest body of folklore America has produced."" <ref>Johnson, James Weldon.  ''The Book of American Negro Poetry'' p. 10</ref>

=== Journalism ===
Early in his career at the ''Atlanta Constitution'', Joe Harris laid out his editorial ideology and set the tone for an agenda that aimed to help reconcile issues of race, class, and region: ""An editor must have a purpose.  [...]  What a legacy for one's conscience to know that one has been instrumental in mowing down the old prejudices that rattle in the wind like weeds.""<ref>Harris, Joel Chandler.  The Sunday Gazette, 5 October 1878.</ref>

Harris served as assistant editor and lead editorial writer at the ''Atlanta Constitution'' primarily between 1876 and 1900, and published articles intermittently until his death in 1908.  While at the Constitution, Harris, ""in thousands of signed and unsigned editorials over a twenty-four-year period, [...] set a national tone for reconciliation between North and South after the Civil War.""<ref>Bickley, Bruce (1986-87).  ''Joel Chandler Harris and the Old and New South: Paradoxes of Perception,""' The Atlanta Historical Journal. Fall-Winter p. 12.</ref>

Throughout his career, Joe Harris actively promoted racial reconciliation as well as African-American education, suffrage, and equality.   He regularly denounced racism among southern whites, condemned lynching as barbaric, and highlighted the importance of higher education for African Americans, frequently citing the work of [[W.E.B. DuBois]] in his editorials.  <ref>Gooch, Cheryl Renee (2009).  ''The Literary Mind of a Cornfield Journalist: Joel Chandler Harris's 1904 Negro Question Articles'', Journal of the International Association for Literary Journalism Studies. Vol. 1, No. 2 p. 79.</ref>  In 1883, for example, editorials from the ''Atlanta Constitution'' challenged those of the ''[[New York Sun]]'' that alleged ""educating the negro will merely increase his capacity for evil.""  The ''Atlanta Constitution'' editorial countered, stating if ""education of the negro is not the chief solution of the problem that confronts the white people of the South then there is no other conceivable solution and there is nothing ahead but political chaos and demoralization.""<ref>Harris, Julia Collier (1931).  Joel Chandler Harris: Editor and essayist.  Chapel Hill University of North Carolina Press. p. 103</ref>  Harris' editorials were often progressive in content and paternalistic in tone.  Harris was unwavering in his commitment to the ""dissipation of sectional jealousy and misunderstanding, as well as religious and racial intolerance""<ref>Odum, Howard (1925).  ''Southern Pioneers in Social Interpretation'', University of North Carolina Press.  p. 153.</ref>, yet ""never entirely freed himself of the idea that the [southern whites] would have to patronize the [southern blacks].""<ref>Bickley (1986-87)</ref>

Paradoxically, Harris also oversaw some of the ''Atlanta Constitution'''s most sensationalized coverage of racial issues, most notably regarding the 1899 torture and lynching of [[Sam Hose]], an African-American farm worker.  Harris resigned from the paper the following year, having lost patience for publishing both ""his iconoclastic views on race"" and ""what was expected of him"" at a major southern newspaper during a particularly vitriolic period. <ref>Martin, Jay.  ""Joel Chandler Harris and the Cornfield Journalist"" in ''Crititcal Essays on Joel Chandler Harris''  Boston: G.K. Hall, 1981.  p. 92-97</ref>

In 1904 Harris wrote four important articles for the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' in discussing the problem of race relations in the South that highlight his progressive yet paternalistic views.  Of these, [[Booker T. Washington]] noted: ""It has been a long time since I have read anything from the pen of any man which has given me such encouragement as your article has.  [...]  In a speech on Lincoln's Birthday which I am to deliver in New York, I am going to take the liberty to quote liberally from what you have said.""<ref>Harlan, Louis R. and John W. Blassingame, eds., The Booker T. Washington Papers: 
Volume 1: The Autobiographical Writings (Open Book Edition, University of Illinois)</ref>

=== Other Works ===
Harris wrote novels, narrative histories, translations of French folklore, children's literature, and collections of stories depicting rural life in Georgia.  The short stories ""[[Free Joe and the Rest of the World]]"", ""Mingo"", and ""At Teague Poteets"" are the most influential of his non-Uncle Remus creative work.  Many of his short stories delved into the changing social and economic values in the South during Reconstruction.  Harris' turn as a local colorist gave voice to poor white characters and demonstrated his fluency with different African-American dialects and characters.<ref>Bickley, 104-105</ref>

[[Image:Joel Chandler Harris - Project Gutenberg eText 16622.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Harris at his [[West End (Atlanta)|West End]] home]]

== Legacy ==
Harris's legacy has largely been ignored by academia, in no small part due to the [[Uncle Remus]] character, use of dialect, plantation setting, and Disney's adaptation of the stories.  Harris' books exerted a profound influence on on storytellers at home and abroad, yet the Uncle Remus tales effectively have no critical standing.<ref name=""Goldthwaite, 256"">Goldthwaite, 256</ref>  His legacy is, at the same time, not without considerable controversy: Harris' critical reputation in the 20th and 21st centuries has been wildly mixed.

=== Criticism ===
Critic [[H. L. Mencken]] held a less than favorable view of Harris: ""Once upon a time a Georgian printed a couple of books that attracted notice, but immediately it turned out that he was little more than an [[amanuensis]] for the local blacks--that his works were really the products, not of white Georgia, but of black Georgia. Writing afterward as a white man, he swiftly subsided into the fifth rank.""<ref>from ''The Sahara of the Bozart''</ref> Keith Cartwright, however, asserts, ""Harris might arguably be called the greatest single authorial force behind the literary development of African American folk matter and manner.""<ref name=""cartwright"">{{cite book | last = Cartwright | first = Keith | title = Reading Africa into American Literature: Epics, Fables, and Gothic Tales | publisher = University of Lexington Press | year = 2001 | isbn = 0813190894 }}</ref>

[[Alice Walker]] accused Harris of ""stealing a good part of my heritage"" in a searing essay called ""Uncle Remus, No Friend of Mine"".<ref>Alice Walker, ""Uncle Remus, No Friend of Mine"", ''[[Southern Exposure (magazine)|Southern Exposure]]'' 9 (Summer 1981): 29-31.</ref> [[Toni Morrison]] wrote a novel called ''Tar Baby'' based on the folktale recorded by Harris.  In interviews, she said she learned the story from her family and owed no debt to Harris.

Some scholars are skeptical of the validity of the stories collected by a white man, citing the difficulty that many white folklorists had in persuading African-Americans to divulge their folklore.<ref name=""levin"">{{cite book | last = Levine | first = Lawrence | title = Black Culture and Black Consciousness: Afro-American Folk Thought from Slavery to Freedom | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1977 | isbn = 0195023749 }}</ref>  Other critical scholars cite Uncle Remus as a problematic and contradictory figure: sometimes a mouthpiece for white paternalism, sometimes a stereotype of the black entertainer, and sometimes poetically subversive.<ref name=""sundquist"">{{cite book | last = Sundquist | first = Eric | title = To Wake the Nations: Race in the Making of American Literature | publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | year = 1998 | isbn = 067489331X }}</ref>

Black folklorist [[Julius Lester]] holds a somewhat kinder view of Harris.  He sees the Uncle Remus stories as important records of black [[folklore]].  He has rewritten many of the Harris stories in an effort to elevate the subversive elements over the purportedly racist ones.  Author [[Ralph Ellison]] also responded to Harris' work positively: ""Aesop and Uncle Remus had taught us that comedy is a disguised form of philosophical instruction; and especially when it allows us to glimpse the animal instincts lying beneath the surface of our civilized affectations.""<ref>Ellison, Ralph. ''Going to the Territory'', Vintage, 1995. p 146. ISBN 0-679-76001-6</ref>

=== Influence ===
[[Image:Uncle remus norman rockwell.jpg|thumb|right|width250|""Uncle Remus"" by [[Norman Rockwell]] circa 1920]]

Children's literature analyst John Goldthwaite argues that the Uncle Remus tales are ""irrefutably the central event in the making of modern children's story.""<ref name=""Goldthwaite, 256""/>  Harris' influence on children's writers like [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]], [[A.A. Milne|Milne]], [[Beatrix Potter|Potter]], [[Thornton Burgess|Burgess]] and [[Enid Blyton|Blyton]] is substantial.  His influence on modernism is less overt, but also evident in the works of [[Ezra Pound|Pound]], [[T.S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[James Joyce|Joyce]], and [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]].

Beatrix Potter illustrated eight scenes from the Uncle Remus stories between 1893 and 1896, coinciding with the first drawings of [[Peter Rabbit]].  Potter's family had favored the Uncle Remus stories during her youth, and she was particularly impressed by the way Harris turned ""the ordinary into the extraordinary.""  Potter borrowed some of the language from the Uncle Remus stories, adopting vocabulary like ""cottontail,"" ""puddle-duck,"" and ""lippity-(c)lippity"" into her own work. <ref>Lear, Linda, ''Beatrix Potter: A Life in Nature''. Macmillan, 2008. p. 131.</ref> 

Mark Twain incorporated several of the Uncle Remus stories into his book tour.  He wrote to [[William Dean Howells]] in the early 1880s, reporting that the ""Tar Baby"" had been received ""best of all"" at a reading in Hartford.<ref>Griska, Joseph M., ''Two New Joel Chandler Harris Reviews of Mark Twain''. Duke University Press, 1977. p. 584.</ref>  Twain admired Harris' use of dialect, and generously appropriated exchanges and turns of phrase in many of his works, most notably in ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]''<ref>Carkeet, David.  ""the Source for the Arkansas Gossips in Huckleberry Finn."" American LIterary Realisim, XIV.  1981.  p. 90 - 92.</ref> and ''[[The Mysterious Stranger]]''. <ref>McCoy, Sharon D., ''The dialect of modernism: race, language, and twentieth century literature''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1994. p. 77.</ref>

A.A. Milne borrowed diction, plot, and narrative structure from several Brer Rabbit stories.  ""Pooh Goes Visiting"" and ""Heyo, House!"" are particularly similar.<ref name=""Goldthwaite, 256""/>  As a boy Milne recalled listening to his father read one Uncle Remus story per night, and referred to it as ""the sacred book.""<ref>Wachtell, Cynthia, ""The Wife of His Youth: A Trickster Tale.""  ''Charles Chesnutt Reappraised: Essays on the First Major African American Fiction Writer''. North Carolina: McFarland and Company, 2009. p. 170.</ref>

[[Charles Chesnutt]]'s most famous work, ''[[The Conjure Woman]]'' is heavily influenced by the Uncle Remus Tales, featuring Uncle Julius as the main character and storyteller.  Chesnutt read the Uncle Remus stories to his own children. <ref>North, Michael, ''The Minstrel Mask of as Alter Ego''. Centenary reflections on Mark Twain's No. 44, the mysterious stranger, 1994. p. 77.</ref>

Many scholars cite Harris' influence on William Faulkner, most importantly in terms of dialect usage,<ref>Bickley, 187.</ref> depictions of African-Americans<ref>Foote, Shelby, Darwin T. Turner, and Evans Harrington. ""Faulkner and Race"". ''The South and Faulkner's Yoknapatawph: The Actual and the Apocryphal''. 1977. p 79 - 90.</ref> and lower-class whites,<ref>Davis, Thadious, ""The Signifying Abstraction: Reading the Negro in ''Absalom, Absalom''."" ''William Faulkner's Absalom, Absalom!: a casebook''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2003. p. 77.</ref> and fictionalized landscape.<ref>Cartwright, 127.</ref>

Poets [[Ezra Pound]] and [[T.S. Eliot]] corresponded in Uncle Remus inspired dialect, referring to themselves as ""Brer Rabbit"" and ""Old Possum,"" respectively.  Eventually the dialect and the personae became a sign of their collaboration against the London literary establishment.  Eliot even titled one of his books ''[[Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats]]''.<ref>North, Michael, ''The Minstrel Mask of as Alter Ego''. Centenary reflections on Mark Twain's No. 44, the mysterious stranger, 1994. p. 77.</ref>

=== Song of the South ===
In 1946, [[the Walt Disney Company]] produced a film based on the Uncle Remus tales called ''[[Song of the South]]''. While commercially successful during its original release and re-releases, the film has never been released for home consumption in the United States. ''Song of the South'' has been released on video in a number of countries outside the US, and on laserdisk in Japan.<ref name=""video"">[http://www.songofthesouth.net/]</ref>

The film garnered mixed critical reviews and two Academy Awards.  [[James Baskett]] won an honorary [[Academy Award]] for his portrayal of Uncle Remus, and [[Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah]] was presented with the award for [[Best Original Song]].  The NAACP acknowledged ""the remarkable artistic merit"" of the film, but decried the ""impression it gives of an idyllic master-slave relationship.""<ref name=""Cohen"">{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Karl F|title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America|year=1997|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc.|location=North Carolina|isbn=0-7864-0395-0|pages=60–68}}</ref>

Since its debut, the public perception of Harris and the Uncle Remus stories has largely been tied to the reception of ''Song of the South''.

=== Landmarks ===
[[Joel Chandler Harris House|The Wren's Nest]], Harris's home in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], is a [[National Historic Landmark]] and has operated as a museum home since 1913.  The Uncle Remus Museum, in [[Eatonton, GA]], also commemorates the life of Harris.  A state historic landmark plaque sits on Bay Street in [[Savannah, GA]] across from the now demolished ''[[Savannah Morning News]]'' building.

Basil cultivars vary in several ways. Visually, the size of the leaves varies greatly, from the large lettuce-like leaves of the ''Mammoth basil'' and ''Lettuce leaf basil'' to the tiny leaves of the ''Dwarf bush basil''. More practically, the fragrance of the basil varies due to the varying types and quantities of [[essential oil]]s contained in the plants. The most important are 1,8 [[cineol]], [[linalool]], [[citral]], methyl chavicol ([[estragole]]), [[eugenol]] and methyl [[cinnamate]], although hardly any basil contains all of these in any significant amount.<ref name=""katzer""/>

. ''For other meanings of this term see the disambiguation page under [[Flying Circus]]''

'''The Flying Circus''' were a short-lived Toronto-based group fronted by singer/songwriter, [[Bruce Cockburn]]. The band, which was active between late 1967 and early 1968, also featured [[Neil Merryweather]] and future [[Mapleoak]] members, [[Marty Fisher]] and Gordon MacBain.

==The Mynah Birds==
After leaving [[The Mynah Birds]] (sometimes spelt Myna Byrds) in early September 1967, Neil Lillie (later better known as Neil Merryweather) was introduced to ex-[[The Esquires (Canadian band)|Esquires]] member Bruce Cockburn through [[The Five Man Electrical Band]]. The pair decided to launch a new group and recruited former [[Bobby Kris & The Imperials]] members Martin Fisher and Gordon MacBain who were playing at the Concorde Tavern in Toronto at the time.  

Signed to [[Harvey Glatt|Harvey Glatt’s]] management, The Flying Circus recorded a number of unreleased tracks in Toronto during late 1967, including Cockburn’s “Flying Circus”, “She Wants To Know”, “I’m Leaving You Out” and “Mother” as well as Lillie’s “Last Hoorah” and “Elephant Song” and Fisher and MacBain’s “Where Is All The Love”. During the same sessions, the band also recorded songs by Cockburn’s former [[The Children (band)|The Children]] cohort, [[William Hawkins (songwriter and poet)|William Hawkins]], such as “Merry Go Round”, “It’s A Dirty Shame” and “Little Bit Stoned”.<ref>Later versions of which may be found on the tribute album, ''[[Dancing Alone: Songs of William Hawkins]]'' ([[True North Records|True North]], 2008), involving the participation of Cockburn.</ref> 

Around this time, the group also recorded a few tracks with another former Children member Sandy Crawley, which were never released. 

On October 1, the band began a residence at [[Le Hibou]] in Ottawa. The following month, from November 14–18, 1967, The Flying Circus played at the Riverboat in Toronto. Over the next few months, the group also opened for [[Wilson Pickett]] and [[Roy Orbison]] at the Capitol Theatre in Ottawa. 

==Flying Circus becomes Olivus==
In early March 1968, Lillie left to form Heather Merryweather and was replaced by former [[Livingstone’s Journey]] member Dennis Pendrith. The group’s road manager, Michael Ferry (Lee Jackson of [[Jon and Lee & The Checkmates]]) suggested that the group should change name to [[Olivus]].

49,b,"Melisende, Queen of Jerusalem",biography,"'''Melisende''' ([[1105]] &ndash; [[September 11]], [[1161]]) was [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Queen of Jerusalem]] from [[1131]] to [[1153]]. She was the eldest daughter of King [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem]] and the [[Armenia]]n princess [[Morphia of Melitene]]. She was named after her paternal grandmother, Melisende of [[Montlhery]], wife of Hugh I, [[Count of Rethel]]. She had three younger sisters: [[Alice of Antioch|Alice]], [[Principality of Antioch|princess of Antioch]]; [[Hodierna of Tripoli|Hodierna]], [[County of Tripoli|countess of Tripoli]]; and [[Ioveta of Bethany|Ioveta]], abbess of St. Lazarus in [[Bethany (Israel)|Bethany]]. Hodierna's daughter, [[Melisende of Tripoli]], was named in honor of the queen.

==Inheritance==
[[Jerusalem]] had recently been conquered by Christian [[Franks]] in [[1099]] during the [[First Crusade]], and was ruled by a dynasty originally from the [[Counts and dukes of Rethel|County of Rethel]] in [[France]]. Melisende was the heir of this dynasty, and was designated her father's successor before 1129. Women who inherited territory usually did so because war and violence brought many men to premature death, and women who were recognized as [[queen regnant]] rarely exercised their authority. Contemporaries of Melisende who did rule, however, included [[Urraca of Castile]] (1080 &ndash; 1129), [[Empress Matilda]] (1102 &ndash; 1169), and [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] (1121 &ndash; 1204). Melisende's authority was not passed over for her son but was independent of it, as [[William of Tyre]] wrote ''reseditque reginam regni potestas penes dominam Melisendem, Deo amabilem reginam, cui jure hereditario competebat'' (""the rule of the kingdom remained in the power of the lady queen Melisende, a queen beloved by God, to whom it passed by hereditary right""). Melisende was no mere regent-queen (for her son Baldwin III), but a Queen Regnant, reigning by right of hereditary and civil law. 

During her father's reign Melisende was styled ''filia regis et regni Jerosolimitani haeres'' (""daughter of the king and heir of the kingdom of Jerusalem"") and took precedence above other nobles and Christian clergy in ceremonial occasions. Increasingly she was associated with her father on official documents, including in the minting of money, granting of fiefdoms and other forms of patronage, and in diplomatic correspondence. Baldwin raised his daughter as a capable successor to himself and Melisende enjoyed the support of the ''[[Haute Cour of Jerusalem|Haute Cour]]'', a kind of royal council comprising the nobility and clergy of the realm. 

However, Baldwin also thought that he would have to marry Melisende to a powerful ally, one who would protect and safeguard Melisende's inheritance as Queen and her future heirs. His intention was for a consort for his daughter, not a reigning king-consort. Baldwin chose [[Fulk of Jerusalem|Fulk V of Anjou]], a renowned crusader and military commander, and in the future the paternal grandfather of [[Henry II of England|Henry Plantagenet]] (Fulk's son of previous marriage, [[Geoffrey of Anjou|Geoffrey]] was in these same years married to Empress Matilda, [[Henry I of England]]'s designated heir as England's next Queen regnant). Throughout the negotiations Fulk insisted on being joint ruler with Melisende. Baldwin acquiesced to these demands as Fulk was relatively rich (even for a crusader) and would bring troops and much military experience with him in defense of Jerusalem. Melisende bore a son and heir in 1130, the future [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin III]]. As an indication of Baldwin II's intentions to make Melisende sole queen and to strengthen her position, he designated Melisende as guardian for the young Baldwin, excluding Fulk altogether. 

After Baldwin II's death in 1131, Melisende and Fulk ascended to the throne as joint rulers. However, with the aid of his crusader knights Fulk excluded Melisende from granting titles and other forms of patronage, and publicly dismissed her authority. This treatment of their Queen irritated the members of the ''Haute Cour'', whose own positions would be eroded if Fulk continued to dominate the realm.

[[Image:Near East 1135.svg|thumb|250px|The Kingdom of Jerusalem and the other Crusader states (in shades of green) in 1135 [[Common Era|CE]] during the reign of Melisende.]]
==Palace intrigue==
The estrangement between husband and wife was a convenient political tool that Fulk used in 1134 when he accused [[Hugh II of Le Puiset]], [[County of Jaffa and Ascalon|Count of Jaffa]], of having an affair with Melisende. Hugh was the most powerful baron in the kingdom, and devotedly loyal to the memory of Baldwin II. This loyalty now extended to Melisende, though Hugh, by strict [[male succession]], held a better claim to the throne. Hugh was a cousin of Melisende, and also a member of the royal family. Contemporary sources, such as [[William of Tyre]], discount the infidelity of Melisende and instead point out that Fulk overly favoured newly arrived Frankish crusaders from Anjou over the native nobility of the kingdom. Had Melisende been guilty the church and nobility likely would not have later rallied to her cause.

Hugh allied himself with the Muslim city of [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]], and was able to hold off the army set against him. He could not maintain his position indefinitely, however. His alliance with Ascalon cost him support at court. The [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch]] negotiated lenient terms for peace, and Hugh was exiled for three years. Soon thereafter an unsuccessful assassination attempt against Hugh was attributed to Fulk or his supporters. This was reason enough for the queen's party to openly challenge Fulk, as Fulk's unfounded assertions of infidelity was a public affront that would damage Melisende's position entirely. 

Through what amounted to a palace coup, the queen's supporters overcame Fulk, and from 1135 onwards Fulk's influence rapidly deteriorated. One historian wrote that Fulk's supporters ""went in terror of their lives"" in the palace. William of Tyre wrote that Fulk ""did not attempt to take the initiative, even in trivial matters, without [Melisende's] knowledge"". Husband and wife reconciled by 1136 and a second son, [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|Amalric]], was born. When Fulk was killed in a hunting accident in 1143, Melisende publicly and privately mourned for him.

Melisende's victory was complete. Again she is seen in the historical record granting titles of nobility, fiefdoms, appointments and offices, granting royal favours and pardons and holding court. Of Melisende, William of Tyre wrote ""reseditque reginam regni potestas penes dominam Melisendem, Deo amabilem reginam, cui jure hereditario competebat."" Melisende was no mere regent-queen for her son Baldwin III, but a Queen Regnant, reigning by right of hereditary and civil law.

==Patroness of the church and arts==
[[Image:Melisende-Psalter f12v.jpg|frame|An illustration from the [[Melisende Psalter]], commissioned during the Queen's reign]]
Melisende enjoyed the support of the church throughout her lifetime; from her appointment as Baldwin II's successor, throughout the conflict with Fulk, and later when Baldwin III would come of age. In 1138 she founded the large convent of [[St. Lazarus]] in Bethany where her younger sister Ioveta would rule as abbess. In keeping with a royal abbey, Melisende granted the convent the fertile plains of [[Jericho]]. Additionally, the queen supplied rich furnishings and liturgical vessels, so that it would not be in any way inferior to religious houses for men. According to author and historian Bernard Hamilton, Melisende also gave large ""endowments to the Holy Sepulchre, our Lady of Josaphat, the Templum Domini, the order of the Hospital, the leper hospital of Saint Lazarus, and the Praemonstratensians of Saint Samuel's."" 

Sometime between 1131 and 1143, the queen commissioned the [[Melisende Psalter]]. Though influenced by Byzantine and Italian traditions in the illuminations, the artists who contributed to it had a unique and decidedly Jerusalem style. The historian Buchtal wrote that ""Jerusalem during the second quarter of the twelfth century possessed a flourishing and well-established scriptorium which could, without difficulty, undertake a commission for a royal manuscript ''de grand luxe''"". Bernard Hamilton argues that Melisende must be given credit for sponsoring the artists in her realm.

==Second Crusade==
In 1144 the [[Crusader states|Crusader state]] of [[County of Edessa|Edessa]] was besieged in a border war that threatened its survival. Queen Melisende responded by sending an army led by [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|constable]] [[Manasses of Hierges]], [[Philip of Milly]], and Elinand of Bures. [[Raymond of Antioch]] ignored the call for help, as his army was already occupied against the Byzantine Empire in Cilicia. Despite Melisende's army, [[Siege of Edessa|Edessa fell]].

Melisende sent word to the Pope in Rome, and the west called for a [[Second Crusade]]. The crusader expedition was led by French [[Louis VII of France|King Louis]] and the German Emperor [[Conrad III]]. Accompanying Louis was his wife [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], with her own vassal lords in tow. Eleanor had herself been designated by her father, [[William IX of Aquitaine|William IX]], to succeed him in her own right, just as Melisende had been designated to succeed her father. 

During the Crusader meeting in Acre in 1148 the battle strategy was planned. Conrad and Louis advised 16-year old Baldwin III to attack the Muslim city-state of [[Damascus]], though Melisende, Manasses, and Eleanor wanted to take [[Aleppo]], which would aid them in retaking Edessa. The meeting ended with Damascus as their target. Damascus and Jerusalem were on very good diplomatic terms and there was a peace treaty between them. The result of this breach of treaty was that Damascus would never trust the Crusader states again, and the loss of a sympathetic Muslim state was a blow from which later monarchs of Jerusalem could not recover. After 11 months Eleanor and Louis departed for France, ending the Second Crusade.

==Mother and son==
Melisende's relationship with her son was complex. As a mother she would know her son and his capabilities, and she is known to have been particularly close to her children. As a ruler she may have been reluctant to entrust decision making powers to an untried youth. Either way there was no political or social pressure to grant Baldwin any authority before 1152, even though Baldwin reached majority in 1145. Baldwin III and Melisende were jointly crowned as co-rulers on Christmas Day, 1143. This joint crowning was similar to Melisende's own crowning with her father in 1128, and may have reflected a growing trend to crown one's heir in the present monarch's lifetime, as demonstrated in other realms of this period.

Baldwin grew up to be a capable, if not brilliant, military commander. By age 24 however, Baldwin felt he could take some responsibility in governance. Melisende had hitherto only partially associated Baldwin in her rule. Tension between mother and son mounted between 1150 and 1152, with Baldwin blaming Manasses for alienating his mother from him. The crisis reached a boiling point early 1152 when Baldwin demanded the [[Patriarch Fulk of Jerusalem|patriarch Fulcher]] to crown him in the Holy Sepulchre, without Melisende present. The Patriarch refused. Baldwin, in protest, staged a procession in the city streets wearing laurel wreaths, a kind of self-crowning. 

Baldwin and Melisende agreed to put the decision to the ''Haute Cour''. The ''Haute Cour'' decided that Baldwin would rule the north of the kingdom and Melisende the richer [[Judea]] and [[Samaria]], and Jerusalem itself. Melisende acquiesced, though with misgivings. This decision would prevent a civil war but also divide the kingdom's resources. Though later historians criticized Melisende for not abdicating in favor of her son, there was little impetus for her to do so. She was universally recognized as an exceptional steward for her kingdom, and her rule had been characterized as a wise one by church leaders and other contemporaries. Baldwin had not shown any interest in governance prior to 1152, and had resisted responsibility in this arena. The Church clearly supported Melisende, as did the barons of Judea and Samaria. 

Despite putting the matter before the ''Haute Cour'', Baldwin was not happy with the partition any more than Melisende. But instead of reaching further compromise, within weeks of the decision he launched an invasion of his mother's realms. Baldwin showed that he was Fulk's son by quickly taking the field; [[Nablus]] and Jerusalem fell swiftly. Melisende with her younger son Amalric and others sought refuge in the [[Tower of David]]. Church mediation between mother and son resulted with the grant of the city of Nablus and adjacent lands to Melisende to rule for life, and a solemn oath by Baldwin III not to disturb her peace. This peace settlement demonstrated that though Melisende lost the ""civil war"" to her son, she still maintained great influence and avoided total obscurity in a convent.

==Retirement==
By 1153 son and mother had been reconciled. Since the civil war, Baldwin had shown his mother great respect. Melisende's connections, especially to her sister Hodierna, and to her niece [[Constance of Antioch]], meant that she had direct influence in northern Syria, a priceless connection since Baldwin had himself broken the treaty with Damascus in 1147. 

As Baldwin III was often on military campaigns he realized he had few reliable advisers. From 1154 onwards she is again associated with her son in many of his official public acts. In 1156 she concluded a treaty with the merchants of [[Pisa]]. In 1157, with Baldwin on campaign in Antioch, Melisande saw an opportunity to take el-Hablis, which controlled the lands of [[Gilead]] beyond the Jordan. Also in 1157, on the death of patriarch Fulcher, Melisende, her half-sister Sibylla of Flanders, and Ioveta the Abbess of Bethany, had Amalric of Nesle appointed as patriarch of Jerusalem. Additionally, Melisende was witness to her son Amalric's marriage to [[Agnes of Courtenay]] in 1157. In 1160 she gave her assent to a grant made by her son Amalric to the Holy Sepulchre, perhaps on the occasion of the birth of her granddaughter [[Sibylla of Jerusalem|Sibylla]] to Agnes and Amalric.

==Death==
In 1161 Melisende had what appears to be a stroke. Her memory was severely impaired and she could no longer take part in state affairs. Her sisters, the countess of Tripoli and abbess of Bethany, came to nurse her before she died on September 11, 1161. Melisende was buried next to her mother Morphia in the shrine of Our Lady of Josaphat. Melisende, like her mother, bequeathed property to the Orthodox monastery of Saint S'eba.

William of Tyre, writing on Melisende's 30-year reign, wrote that ""she was a very wise woman, fully experienced in almost all affairs of state business, who completely triumphed over the handicap of her sex so she could take charge of important affairs..."", and ""striving to emulate the glory of the best princes, Melisende ruled the kingdom with such ability that she was rightly considered to have equalled her predecessors in that regard."" William of Tyre's comments may seem rather patronizing to a modern audience, wrote professor Bernard Hamilton of the University of Nottingham, however this was a great show of respect from a society and culture in which women were regarded with less rights and authority than their brothers, fathers, and even sons.

'''Buckley Air Force Base''' {{Airport codes|BKF|KBKF|BKF}} is a [[United States Air Force]] base in [[Aurora, Colorado]], that was established by the [[U.S. Army]] in 1943. The base was named in honor of the [[World War I]] Army pilot [[United States Army officer rank insignia|1LT]] John Harold Buckley. 

==Overview==
Buckley Air Force Base is an [[Air Force Space Command]] base that serves more than 92,000 active duty, National Guard, Reserve and retired personnel throughout the Front Range community. Buckley AFB defends America through its air operations, space-based missile warning capabilities, space surveillance operations, space communications operations and support functions.<ref name=""BAFB"">[http://www.buckley.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=4455 Buckley AFB Tenant Units] Official site</ref>

==Units==
The mission of Buckley Air Force Base's host unit, the [[460th Space Wing]] is to deliver global infrared surveillance, tracking missile warning for theater and homeland defense and provide combatant commanders with expeditionary warrior Airmen.  The 460th Space Wing is broken into three groups, each responsible for a distinct part of the Buckley Air Force Base mission.<ref name=""BAFB""/>

* 460th Operations Group
: Provides missile warning, missile defense, technical intelligence, satellite command and control, battlespace characterization and robust communications. The group's team of space professionals operates the Defense Support Program satellite, which provides continuous global surveillance, tracking and targeting.<ref name=""BAFB""/> 

* 460th Mission Support Group
: Provides trained personnel to support the Air Expeditionary Forces and Homeland Defense. The group is responsible for force protection, quality of life, human resources, contracting, logistics, base infrastructure and environmental stewardship support to the 460th SW, its customers and the base operational missions.<ref name=""BAFB""/> 

* 460th Medical Group
: Supports military readiness to the Air Expeditionary Forces and Homeland Defense missions by ensuring base personnel are medically qualified for deployments and providing health care, life skills support, family advocacy, aerospace medicine, public health, bioenvironmental engineering, optometry, ancillary services health and wellness services and dental care.<ref name=""BAFB""/>  

The base also hosts the [[Colorado Air National Guard]] [[120th Fighter Squadron]] and its [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16C]] fighters, the 140th Wing also includes the [[Air Mobility Command]]'s 200th Airlift Squadron, operating the [[C-21]] Learjet; the [[Air Force Space Command]]'s 137th Space Warning Squadron; and the [[Pacific Air Forces]]'s 240th Civil Engineering Flight. Air National Guardsmen of the Colorado Air National Guard provide services during national emergencies or wartime and natural disasters. The Colorado Air National Guard is an integral part of the Operation Noble Eagle mission responsible for the 24-hour-a-day defense of the land, sea, and air of the [[United States]].<ref>[http://www.cobuck.ang.af.mil/ Colorado Air National Guard Buckley] - official site</ref>

The ANG's state and federal mission is to provide trained, well-equipped men and women who can augment the active force during national emergencies or war, and provide assistance during natural disasters and civil disturbances. The guard plays a significant role in the Noble Eagle mission responsible for 24-hour defense of the land, sea and air of the continental United States.<ref name=""BAFB""/> 

The [[Colorado Army National Guard]] operates the Army Aviation Support Facility at Buckley AFB and is responsible for supplying personnel and equipment for [[CH-47]] Chinook, [[UH-1]] Huey, and [[UH-60]] Blackhawk helicopters.<ref name=""BAFB""/>

==History==
===World War II===
[[File:NAS Denver NAN2-48.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the Naval Air Station Denver in the late 1940s]]
During the early years of [[World War II]] the city of [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] purchased a {{convert|5740|acre|km2|0|sing=on}} parcel of land several miles east of the city and donated it to the Department of the Army. The site was named '''Buckley Field''' after [[First Lieutenant|1st Lt.]] John Harold Buckley, a [[Longmont, Colorado]], native, who was killed while on a combat strafing mission behind enemy lines in [[France]] on September 17, 1918.    

Under the command of the 336th AAF Base Unit (Army Air Forces Technical Training Command), construction on this air base began in early 1942, and that resulted in the construction of over 700 buildings.  On 1 July 1942, the [[U.S. Army Air Corps]] Technical Training School there opened. It consisted of bombardier and armorer training for aircrewmen on the [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] and [[B-24 Liberator]] bombers.  During World War II, Buckley Field also trained over 50,000 airmen in initial basic training.

===The Cold War years===
With World War II over, Buckley Field's military role quickly diminished, and in 1946 it became an auxiliary field of the nearby [[Lowry Air Force Base]]. Lowry in turn transferred control of the base to the [[Colorado Air National Guard]] that same year. [[Air National Guard]] ownership lasted less than one year, and then in 1947 the [[Department of the Navy]] took charge of the base and renamed it Naval Air Station Denver. The renamed base was the location of Naval Air Reserve aviation squadrons, as well as for veterans and their families waiting to return to civilian life. Thousands of veterans returned to civilian life here over the next four years, while Naval Air Reservists concurrently conducted operational training. The Navy remained here for 12 years before decommissioning its base on June 30, 1959, and transferring it back to the U.S. Air Force (which had not existed before 1947), which renamed the facility Buckley Air Force Base.  However, the Naval Reserve remained at Buckley as tenant activity known as Naval Air Reserve Center Denver, the predecessor of the present day Navy Operational Support Center Denver. 

Buckley Field once again became the Buckley Air National Guard Base on April 18, 1960.  At the same time, it became the first stand-alone [[Air National Guard]] base in the country.  The [[Colorado Air National Guard]] remained in control of Buckley Field for the next 40 years, operating it as a fighter base.

During the [[Cold War]] era, the Colorado Air National Guard mobilized the Buckley-based 120th Tactical Fighter Squadron for such historical events as the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], the [[USS Pueblo (AGER-2)|USS ''Pueblo'' crisis]], and the [[Vietnam War]].

During the 1970s and 1980s, the growth of Aurora, Denver's eastern neighbor, edged toward Buckley Field, and the land of the air base was eventually annexed by that city, although the installation remains U.S. Government property under Federal vice municipal jurisidction. 

Other tenant units at Buckley Field during the Cold War era included the:
* ''154th Tactical Air Support Group'', an [[Air National Guard]] (ANG) unit trained to provide [[close air support]] for [[United States Army]] ground operations.  The 154th Group had its own truck-mounted tactical [[radar]] units and radar-control vans, but no aircraft were assigned to the [[Group (air force unit)|Group]].  (circa 1970 through 1989)

===Modern era===
Although the Cold War ended in the early 1990s, the 120th Tactical Fighter Wing did not see any decrease in its responsibilities.  This Fighter Wing deployed from Buckley Field numerous times during the decade of the 1990s to take part in various military operations such as [[Operation Desert Storm]], [[Operation Northern Watch]], and [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]].

In October 2000, the Buckley Air National Guard base was transferred to U.S. Air Force control, and it was renamed the Buckley Air Force Base.

Since the return of Buckley Field to the Air Force in 2000, the air base has seen an unprecedented amount of new construction and modernization. New enlisted airmen's dormitories, the commissary, the base exchange, and the fitness center have all been completed, augmented by the completion of family housing units - the first ones ever constructed at Buckley Field.

'''''The Age of Intelligent Machines''''' is a non-fiction book about [[artificial intelligence]] by inventor and [[futurology|futurist]] [[Ray Kurzweil]]. This was his first book and the [[Association of American Publishers]] named it the ''Most Outstanding Computer Science Book of 1990''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Colin|first=Johnson|title=Era of Smart People is Dawning|journal=Electronic Engineering Times|date=1998-12-28}}</ref> It was reviewed in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''.  The format is a combination of monograph and anthology with contributed essays by artificial intelligence experts such as [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Douglas Hofstadter]], and [[Marvin Minsky]].{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990}}

Kurzweil surveys the [[philosophy|philosophical]], [[mathematics|mathematical]] and [[technology|technological]] roots of artificial intelligence, starting with the assumption that a sufficiently advanced [[computer program]] could exhibit human-level [[intelligence]]. Kurzweil argues the creation of humans through [[evolution]] suggests that humans should be able to build something more intelligent than themselves. He believes [[pattern recognition]], as demonstrated by [[visual perception|vision]], and knowledge representation, as seen in [[language]], are two key components of intelligence. Kurzweil details how quickly computers are advancing in each domain.

Driven by the exponential improvements in computer power, Kurzweil believes artificial intelligence will be possible and then commonplace. He explains how it will impact all areas of people's lives, including [[employment|work]], [[education]], [[medicine]], and [[war]]fare. As computers acquire human level faculties Kurzweil says people will be challenged to figure out what it really means to be human.

==Background==

Ray Kurzweil is an inventor and serial entrepreneur. In 1990 when this book was published he had already started three companies: Kurzweil Computer Products, [[Kurzweil Music Systems]], and Kurzweil Applied Intelligence. The companies developed and sold reading machines for the blind, music synthesizers, and speech recognition software respectively. [[Optical character recognition]], which he used in the reading machine, and [[speech recognition]] are both featured centrally in the book as examples of pattern recognition problems. After the publication of ''The Age of Intelligent Machines'' he expanded on its ideas with two follow-on books: ''[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]'' and the best selling ''[[The Singularity is Near]]''.

==Content==

===Definition and history===
[[File:Origin of Species.jpg|thumb|right|350px|alt=Picture of title page for Darwin's On The Origin of Species|Kurzweil believes evolution proves humans can create a technology more intelligent than themselves.]]

Kurzweil starts by trying to define artificial intelligence. He leans towards Marvin Minsky's ""moving frontier"" formulation: ""the study of computer problems which have not yet been solved"".{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990|p=14}} Then he struggles with defining intelligence itself and concludes ""there appears to be no ''simple'' definition of intelligence that is satisfactory to most observers"".{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990|p=18}} That leads to a discussion about whether [[evolution]], the process, could be considered intelligent.{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990|p=21}}

Kurzweil concludes that evolution is intelligent, but with an [[IQ]] only ""infinitesimally greater than zero"". He penalizes evolution for the extremely long time it takes to create its designs. The human brain operates much more quickly, evidenced by the rate of progress in the last few thousand years, so the brain is more intelligent than its creator. Kurzweil concludes from this that there is no theoretical reason why the human brain cannot create something more intelligent than itself, and suggests ""a sufficient number of decades or centuries into the future"" humans will in fact be surpassed by their creations.{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990|p=21}}

The field of artificial intelligence presupposes that the human brain is a machine, and that an alternative implementation could be built, as a computer program, which would have the same faculties as the real thing. Kurzweil traces the philosophical underpinnings of this tenet, as well as the opposing view that properties such as consciousness and free will are unique to the human mind. Kurzweil starts with [[Plato]] and touches quickly on [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] and ends with [[Hubert Dreyfus]].{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990|pp=23-39}} Kurzweil also presents the mathematical roots of Artificial Intelligence including contributions by [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Alan Turing]], [[Alonzo Church]], and [[Kurt Gödel]]. The [[Turing test]] is introduced as a way to gauge whether the field of artificial intelligence has succeeded or not.{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990|pp=103-117}}

===Chess and pattern recognition===
[[File:Go board.jpg|thumb|left|300px|alt=The Japanese game called go|It is much harder to program computers to play [[Go (game)|the Japanese game of go]] than it is chess.]]

Kurzweil discusses how computers play chess in detail, building to his prediction that ""we will see a [computer] world champion by the year 2000"".{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990|p=133}} The Japanese strategy game of [[Go (game)|go]], however, has proven much for difficult for computers to play well. He considers go to be a ""level 3"" problem, the type of problem where there is no single unifying formula which solves it. Then Kurzweil reveals that pattern recognition, which is crucial to artificial intelligence, is also a level 3 problem.{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990|pp=138-139}}

Kurzweil traces various ways of doing pattern recognition, from the rise and fall of [[perceptron]]s to random [[neural network|neural nets]] and [[decision tree]]s, finally explaining that intelligence is a hierarchy of heterogeneous processes ""communicating and influencing each other"".{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990|pp=139-145}} He believes [[Marvin Minsky]]'s [[society of mind]] and [[Jerome Lettvin]]'s society of neurons are useful models. Kurzweil differentiates logical thinking from pattern recognition, and explains that AI has had much more trouble with pattern recognition, exemplified by efforts to create artificial vision.{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990|p=224}}

Kurzweil estimates that human vision does the equivalent of 100 trillion multiplications per second where ""a typical personal computer"" of the day could only do 100,000 multiplications per second.{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990|p=227}} The way out of this dillema is parallel processing, having millions or billions of simultaneous processes all computing at the same time, something Kurzweil felt would happen in the future.{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990|p=229}} Kurzweil also discusses speech recognition, which like vision requires complex pattern recognition.{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990|pp=263-271}}

===Knowledge and art===

{{Quote box
 |quote = Facts alone do not constitute knowledge. For information to become knowledge, it must incorporate the relationships between ideas. And for the knowledge to be useful, the links describing how concepts interact must be easily accessed, updated, and manipulated.

}}

Representative knowledge is an important aspect of intelligence, just as pattern recognition is. Kurzweil details several types of [[expert system]]s in medicine, insurance and one for garage mechanics.{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990|pp=292-302}} Knowledge is expressed by language and Kurzweil discusses the state of language understanding including projects such as [[Terry Winograd]]'s [[SHRDLU]].{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990|p=307}} Kurzweil says robotics is where all AI technologies are used: ""vision, pattern recognition, knowledge engineering, decision-making, natural-language understanding and others"".{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990|p=321}} He explains how robots are increasingly successful in structured environments like factories, and predicts that ""effective robotic servants in the home will probably not appear until early next century"".{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990|p=322}}

As a high school student Kurzweil built a computer which could compose music and demonstrated it on the national TV show  ''[[I've Got a Secret]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Grossman|first=Lev|title=2045: The Year Man Becomes Immortal|journal=Time Magazine|date=2011-02-10|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2048299,00.html|accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref> In ''The Age of Intelligent Machines'' he discusses the relationship between artificial intelligence and the production of music and visual art by computers. He includes the freehand drawings of [[AARON]] as well as plotter art by Colette and Charles Bangert. He briefly mentions artificial life, shows a number of computer generated fractals, and writes that ""the role of the computer is not to displace human creativity but rather to amplify it.""{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990|p=368}}

===Impact===

{{Main|Predictions made by Ray Kurzweil#The_Age_of_Intelligent_Machines_(1990)|l1=Predictions made by Ray Kurzweil}}
Kurzweil explains that the ""functionality per unit cost"" in the computer industry has been increasing exponentially for decades.  He says computer memory costs one one-hundred millionth of what it did in 1950, for example.{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990|p=401}} Kurzweil admits exponential trends do not last forever, but is convinced computer power could increase by millions of times beyond the 1990 level. If these trends continue, Kurzweil argues, we will see a ""translating telephone"" by 2010, intelligent assistants by the mid-1990s, and a ""completely driverless car"" by ""well into the first half"" of the 21st century.{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990|p=411}} He anticipates we will prove our identity by finger and voice prints and that artificial people will be present as holograms or robots.{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990|pp=405-414}} 

[[File:Turing Test Version 3.svg|thumb|left|200px|alt=Diagram of the Turing Test|Kurzweil believes computers will pass the [[Turing test]] this century.]]

Kurzweil goes into detail about the [[Turing test]] and explains that ""sometime between 2020 and 2070"" the test will be passed to such a degree that ""no reasonable person familiar with the field"" will question the result.{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990|p=416}} 
Even as artificial intelligence replaces whole industries, Kurzweil insists there will still be a net gain of jobs.{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990|p=426}} He says fields like ""communication, teaching, learning, selling, strategic-decicion making and innovation"" will continue to be staffed by humans. At work he predicts people will use electronic documents that will be a ""web of relationships"" like [[Ted Nelson]]'s [[hypertext]] instead of linear like a book.{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990|p=428}}

As far as education Kurzweil feels children will have portable computers on which to run ""intelligent and entertaining courseware"". Papers, exams, electronic mail and even ""love notes"" will be sent over wireless networks.{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990|p=431}}  All the advanced capability will alter the domain of warfare as well, leading to laser and particle beam weapons, and planes without human pilots.{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990|p=437}} Medicine will entail computer diagnosticians, coordinated data banks of patient histories, realistic simulations for drug designers, and robotically assisted surgery. This leaves humans open to do research, organize knowledge and administer ""comfort and caring"".{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990|p=441}}

Handicapped individuals will be greatly assisted by the advancing technology with reading machines, hearing machines, and robotic exoskeletons. Kurzweil believes the prejudice the handicapped now suffer will abate with their new abilities.{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990|p=442}} Kurzweil concludes the book by explaining that all of these advances will challenge us; as computers do ever more tasks that used to be our sole domain, as our intelligence is rivaled and then eclipsed by machines, he feels we will need to figure out what makes us human.{{sfn|Kurzweil|1990|p=449}}

==Essays==
Sprinkled throughout the book are 23 essays, 4 of them by Kurzweil himself and 19 others by invited authors: Margaret Litvin, [[Daniel Dennett]], Mitchell Waldrop, [[Sherry Turkle]], Blaine Mathieu, [[Seymour Papert]], [[Douglas Hofstadter]], [[Marvin Minsky]], Edward Feigenbaum, Jeff Pepper, K. Fuchi, [[Brian Oakley]], [[Harold Cohen (artist)|Harold Cohen]], Charles Ames, Michael Lebowitz, [[Roger Schank]] and Christopher Owens, [[Allen Newell]], [[Margaret Boden]], and [[George Gilder]].

==Reception==
Jay Garfield in the [[New York Times]] wrote that Kurzweil is ""clear, current and informative"" when writing about areas he has worked directly in, but ""sloppy and vague"" when talking about philosophy, logic and psychology. Of the prediction for a ""translating telephone"" by the first decade of the 21st cenutry, Garfield says Kurzweil overlooks ""the mammoth difficulties that confront anyone who tries to accomplish such a task"".<ref name=garfield>{{cite news|last=Garfield|first=Jay|title=Machine See, Machine Do|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/09/books/machine-see-machine-do.html|accessdate=8 February 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=9 September 1900}}</ref>

''The Futurist'' calls it an ""impressive volume"" which is ""handsomely illustrated"" and ""a feast for the mind and eye"".,<ref name=""futurist"">{{cite journal|title=The Age of Intelligent Machines|journal=The Futurist|date=1991-03-01|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-10467009.html|accessdate=2013-02-28}}</ref> while [[Simson Garfinkel]] in [[The Christian Science Monitor]] says ''The Age of Intelligent Machines'' is ""a tour de force history of artificial intelligence"" yet laments that ""although the book is orderly, it is not organized"" and complains that ""details are missing throughout"".<ref name=garfinkel>{{cite news|last=Simson|first=Garfinkel|title=Trying to Make Computers More Like Humans|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1990/1002/dbkurz.html|accessdate=8 February 2013|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|date=2 October 1990}}</ref> 

Linda Strauss writing for [[Science, Technology & Human Values]] calls the book ""a rich assemblage of glittering parts, rather awkwardly joined"". She points out that Kurzweil really cannot define artificial intelligence, the subject of the book, because he cannot define intelligence. Instead he relies on the [[Turing test]] and on Marvin Minsky's notion of intelligence as a moving horizon of unsolved problems. Strauss feels Kurzweil does not consider the cultural and societal implications of his futuristic visions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Strauss|first=Linda|title=Book Reviews: The Age of Intelligent Machines by Raymond Kurzweil|journal=[[Science, Technology & Human Values]]|volume= 17| issue =  3, Summer 1992|pages=396–401}}</ref>

'''Launceston Airport''' {{airport codes|LST|YMLT}} is a regional airport on the outskirts of [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]], [[Tasmania]]. Situated in the rural area of Western Junction, the airport is located {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Launceston City Centre. [[Hobart International Airport]] and Launceston Airport are the only two airports in Tasmania to reach one million passenger movements per year. And like its Hobart counterpart Launceston is a curfew free [[airport]]. In the 2007/2008 Financial Year, Launceston Airport recorded a record 1.1 million passengers. Up 10% on the previous year. During the first three months of 2008, 309,000 passengers passed through Launceston Airport, the most in any previous yearly quarter. Up 11% on the previous year. <ref>[http://www.launcestonairport.com.au/asp/content.asp?articleID=529&id=154 Launceston Airport, Tasmania, Australia - Media Releases<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==History==
[[Image:Virgin Blue Launceston.jpg|thumb|left|[[Virgin Blue]] passengers disembarking at Launceston Airport]]
After the formation of the Tasmanian Aero Club in 1927, the building of the first air travel facility in Tasmania on the site, the ''Western Junction Aerodrome'', began and was first used in 1930, with the [[aerodrome]] being officially opened in 1929.<ref>[http://www.elaunceston.com/launcestonhistory/jun07news.htm Launceston Historical Society Inc]</ref> In 1962 a plan for major redevelopment of the airport was approved. This included strengthening of all pavements, a [[runway]] extension, and soon after a new [[airport terminal|terminal]] building.<ref>[http://www.launcestonairport.com.au/subsector.php?id=107997 A Brief History of Aviation in Tasmania and the Launceston Airport]</ref> The site was officially reopened that same year as ''Launceston Airport''. In October 1982 the runway was further upgraded to [[Boeing 767]] standard. In 1998, the airport was privatized, now being owned by a group known as [[Australia Pacific Airports Corporation Limited]], who is also the owner of [[Melbourne Airport]], in conjunction with [[Launceston City Council]]. The collapse of [[Ansett Australia]] in 2001, the introduction of [[Virgin Blue]] and the [[Qantas]] subsidiary [[Jetstar Airways]] in 2001 & 2004, and the creation of the Australian Low Cost Airline market have all contributed to a dramatic increase in aircraft movements at Launceston Airport. In 2007 Launceston Airport celebrated the milestone of reaching one million passenger movements per year as well as the introduction of [[Tiger Airways Australia]].<ref>[http://www.jetstar.com/pdf/news/20071009.pdf Jetstar congratulates Launceston Airport on one million passenger milestone]</ref>


==Terminal building==
The terminal building services the four interstate airlines: [[QantasLink]], Jetstar, Virgin Blue and Tiger Airways Australia.

Presently the small terminal is inadequate for the amount of passengers that pass through each day. At times where there are 3-4 planes on the tarmac the terminal can become extremely congested. {{Fact|date=September 2008}}

===Terminal Upgrade===
A much needed $20 million dollar upgraded has just been started in June and is expected to be finished in mid 2009. <ref>[http://www.launcestonairport.com.au/asp/content.asp?articleID=529&id=157 Launceston Airport, Tasmania, Australia - Media Releases<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The project will consist of three main parts that will provide Checked Bag Screening and new check in counter areas, new baggage reclaim procedure, with the use of two baggage carousels and new passenger lounges and screening facilities.  This will approximately double the floor area of the terminal allowing for greater space passenger movement and associated activities.  

The first of the three parts of the project, the check bag screening and check in counters will be operational by December 2008, as required by Federal legislation for passenger security.  The other two areas will come on stream in stages over the remaining construction period.

The refurbishment of the departures area will allow a single location for all airlines to provide check in facilities at the 12 new counters.  These counters are linked to a new baggage handling system to a new check bag screening process for all baggage travelling on aircraft.

A revised passenger screening point will increase the level of space provided to passengers during the screening process.

For departing passengers new apron level gate lounges of approximately 1200m2 provide space and security for passengers waiting to board aircrafts.  For arriving passengers, a new baggage handling building of 500m2 incorporating two new baggage carousels will improve baggage reclaim activities for passengers.

For attending public, an expansion of an additional 1000m2 of the main passenger public lounge area and refurbished retail areas, will provide additional space and seating areas with a view of the apron and runway.

==Ground transport==
Launceston Airport has a Short Term and a Long Term Car Park, as well as an Overflow Carpark that can accommodate 150 Cars. 

Airport Shuttle Buses operate mainly from the City Centre to the airport.

==Launceston Airport Business Park==
In a separate development adjacent to the airport site there is a A$200m business park under construction which will include a Caltex service station, an Airport Motor Inn, retail showrooms and also plans for a A$36m Big Box retail development.{{Fact|date=September 2008}}


==Passenger statistics==
Launceston Airport's passenger numbers have increased dramatically in recent years, significantly exceeding the airports forecasts in the ''Airport Master Plan 2005''. The passenger numbers achieved in the 2007-08 [[fiscal year]] were not anticipated until at least fiscal year 2019-20. <ref>http://www.launcestonairport.com.au/bloogoocms/uploads/files/Master%20Plan/2005%20Master%20Plan.pdf</ref>

'''Philosophy of mind''' is the branch of [[philosophy]] that studies the nature of the [[mind]], [[mental event]]s, [[mental function]]s, [[mental property|mental properties]] and [[consciousness]], and their relationship to the physical body. The ''mind-body problem'', i.e. the relationship of the mind to the body, is commonly seen as the central issue in philosophy of mind, although there are other issues concerning the nature of the mind that do not involve its relation to the physical body.<ref name=""Kim1"">{{cite book

''[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Dualism]]'' and ''[[monism]]'' are the two major schools of thought that attempt to resolve the mind-body problem. Dualism is the position that mind and body are in some way separate from each other. It can be traced back to [[Plato]],<ref name=""Plato"">{{cite book

(1996) ""Dualism"", in Samuel Guttenplan (org) ''A Companion to the Philosophy of Mind'', Blackwell, Oxford, 265-7. </ref>

''Monism'' rejects the [[Dualist|dualist]] separation and maintains that mind and body emerge in a universe that has no [[ontology|ontological]] divisions. This view was first advocated in [[Western Philosophy]] by  [[Parmenides]] in the 5th Century BC and was later espoused by the 17th Century [[Rationalism|rationalist]] [[Baruch Spinoza]].<ref name=""Spin""> Spinoza, Baruch (1670) ''Tractatus Theologico-Politicus'' (A Theologico-Political Treatise).</ref> Rough parallels in [[Eastern Philosophy]] might be the Hindu concept of [[Brahman]] or the [[Tao]] of [[Lao Tzu]].  ''[[Physicalism|Physicalists]]'' argue that only the entities postulated by physical theory exist, and that the mind can be explained by the evolution of physical theory.  ''[[idealism (philosophy)|Idealists]]'' maintain that the mind is all that exists and that the external world is either mental itself, or an illusion created by the mind. ''[[neutral monism|Neutral monists]]'' adhere to the position that there is some other, neutral substance, and that both matter and mind are properties of this unknown substance. The most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism; these positions include [[behaviorism]], the [[type physicalism|type identity theory]], [[anomalous monism]] and [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]].<ref name=""Kim"">Kim, J., ""Mind-Body Problem"", ''Oxford Companion to Philosophy''. Ted Honderich (ed.). Oxford:Oxford University Press. 1995.</ref>

Many modern philosophers of mind adopt either a ''reductive'' or ''non-reductive physicalist'' position, maintaining in their different ways that the mind is not something separate from the brain. <ref name=""Kim"" /> ''Reductivists'' assert that all mental states and properties will eventually be explained by neuroscientific accounts of brain processes and states.<ref name=""Pat"">{{cite book | author=Churchland, Patricia | title=Neurophilosophy: Toward a Unified Science of the Mind-Brain. | publisher=MIT Press | year=1986 | id=ISBN 0-262-03116-7 }}</ref><ref name=""Paul"">{{cite journal | author=Churchland, Paul | title=Eliminative Materialism and the Propositional Attitudes | journal=Journal of Philosophy | year=1981 | pages=67-90}}</ref><ref name=""Smart""> {{cite journal | author=Smart, J.J.C. | title=Sensations and Brain Processes | journal=Philosophical Review | year=1956}}</ref> ''Non-reductionists'' argue that although the brain is all there ''is'' to the mind, the predicates and vocabulary used in mental descriptions and explanations are indispensable, and cannot be reduced to the language and lower-level explanations of physical science.<ref name=""Davidson"">{{cite book | author=Donald Davidson | title=Essays on Actions and Events | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1980 | id=ISBN 0-19-924627-0 }}</ref><ref name=""Pu""> Putnam, Hilary (1967).

==The mind-body problem==
The mind-body problem concerns the explanation of the relationship, if any, that obtains between [[mind]]s, or mental processes, and bodily states or processes.<ref name=""Kim1"" /> One of the aims of philosophers who work in this area is to explain how a supposedly non-material mind can influence a material body and vice-versa. 

Our perceptual experiences depend on [[stimulation|stimuli]] which arrive at our various [[Sensory system|sensory organs]] from the external world and these stimuli cause changes in our mental states; ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a slice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move their body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain what they want. The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of an inert lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties.<ref name=""Kim"" />  A related problem is to explain how someone's [[propositional attitude]]s (e.g. beliefs and desires) can cause that individual's [[neuron]]s to fire and his muscles to contract in exactly the correct manner. These comprise some of the puzzles that have confronted [[Epistemology|epistemologists]] and philosophers of mind from at least the time of [[René Descartes]].<ref name=""De"" />

==Dualist solutions to the mind-body problem==
[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Dualism]] is a set of views about the relationship between [[mind]] and [[matter]]. It begins with the claim that mental [[phenomenon|phenomena]] are, in some respects, non-[[nature|physical]].<ref name=""Du"" /> One of the earliest known formulations of mind-body dualism was expressed in the eastern [[Sankhya]] and [[Yoga]] schools of Hindu philosophy (c. 650 BCE), which divided the world into [[purusha]] (mind/spirit) and [[prakrti]] (material substance).<ref name=""Sa"" /> Specifically, the [[Yoga Sutra]] of [[Patanjali]] presents an analytical approach to the nature of the mind. 

In [[Western Philosophy]], the earliest discussions of dualist ideas are in the writings of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. Each of these maintained, but for different reasons, that man's ""intelligence"" (a faculty of the mind or soul) could not be identified with, or explained in terms of, his physical body.<ref name=""Plato"" /><ref name=""Rob"" /> However, the best-known version of dualism is due to [[René Descartes]] (1641), and holds that the mind is a non-extended, non-physical substance.<ref name=""De"" />  Descartes was the first to clearly identify the mind with [[consciousness]] and [[self-awareness]], and to distinguish this from the brain, which was the seat of intelligence. He was therefore the first to formulate the mind-body problem in the form in which it still exists today.<ref name=""De"" />

===Arguments for dualism===
The main argument in favor of dualism is that it seems to appeal to the common-sense intuition of the vast majority of non-philosophically-trained people. If asked what the mind is, the average person will usually respond by identifying it with their [[self]], their [[personality]], their [[soul]], or some other such entity. They will almost certainly deny that the mind simply ''is'' the brain, or vice-versa, finding the idea that there is just one [[ontology|ontological]] entity at play to be too mechanistic, or simply unintelligible.<ref name=""Du"" /> The majority of modern philosophers of mind think that these intuitions, like many others, are probably misleading and that we should use our critical faculties, along with empirical evidence from the sciences, to examine these assumptions and  determine if there is any real basis to them.<ref name=""Du"" />

Another important argument in favor of dualism is the idea that the mental and the physical seem to have quite different, and perhaps irreconcilable, properties.<ref name=""Ja"">Jackson, F. (1982) “[http://members.aol.com/NeoNoetics/Mary.html Epiphenomenal Qualia].” Reprinted in Chalmers, David ed. :2002. ''Philosophy of Mind: Classical and Contemporary Readings''. Oxford University Press.</ref>  Mental events have a certain subjective quality to them, whereas physical events do not. So, for example, one can reasonably ask what a burnt finger feels like, or what a blue sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like to a person. But it is meaningless, or at least odd, to ask what a surge in the uptake of [[glutamate]] in the dorsolateral portion of the [[hippocampus]] feels likes. 

Philosophers of mind call the subjective aspects of mental events ''[[qualia]]'' (or ''raw feels'').<ref name=""Ja"" />  There is something ''that it is like'' to feel pain, to see a familiar shade of blue, and so on. There are qualia involved in these mental events that seem particularly difficult to reduce to anything physical.<ref name=""Nagel"">{{cite journal | author=Nagel, T. | title=What is it like to be a bat? | journal=Philosophical Review | issue=83 | pages=435-456 |year=1974.}}</ref>

===Interactionist dualism===
[[Image:Descartes.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[René Descartes]] by [[Frans Hals]] (1648)]]
Interactionist dualism, or simply interactionism, is the particular form of dualism first espoused by Descartes in the ''Meditations''.<ref name=""De"" /> In the 20th century, its major defenders have been [[Karl Popper]] and [[John Carew Eccles]].<ref name=""PopE"">{{cite book | author=Popper, Karl and Eccles, John | title=The Self and Its Brain | publisher=Springer Verlag | year=2002 | id=ISBN 3-492-21096-1 }}</ref> It is the view that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, causally interact with physical states.<ref name=""Du"" />  

Descartes' famous argument for this position can be summarized as follows: Seth has a clear and distinct idea of his mind as a thinking thing which has no spatial extension (i.e., it cannot be measured in terms of length, weight, height, and so on). He also has a clear and distinct idea of his body as something that is spatially extended, subject to quantification and not able to think. It follows that mind and body are not identical because they have radically different properties. Descartes.<ref name=""De"" />

At the same time, however, it is clear that Seth's mental states (desires, beliefs, etc.) have [[causality|causal]] effects on his body and vice-versa: A child touches a hot stove (physical event) which causes pain (mental event) and makes him yell (physical event), this in turn provokes a sense of fear and protectiveness in the mother (mental event), and so on.

Descartes' argument crucially depends on the premise that what Seth believes to be ""clear and distinct"" ideas in his mind are necessarily true. Many contemporary philosophers doubt this. For example, [[Joseph Agassi]] believes that several scientific discoveries made since the early [[20th century]] have undermined the idea of privileged access to one's own ideas. [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] has shown that a psychologically-trained observer can understand a person's unconscious motivations better than she does. [[Pierre Duhem|Duhem]] has shown that a philosopher of science can know a person's methods of discovery better than he does, while [[Bronislaw Malinowski|Malinowski]] has shown that an anthropologist can know a person's customs and habits better than he does. He also asserts that modern psychological experiments that cause people to see things that are not there provide grounds for rejecting Descartes' argument, because scientists can describe a person's perceptions better than he can.<ref>{{cite book | author=Agassi, J. | title=La Scienza in Divenire | publisher=Armando | location=Rome | year=1997}}</ref>

===Other forms of dualism===
[[Image:Dualism.png|400px|thumb|Three varieties of dualism. The arrows indicate the direction of the causal interactions. Property dualism is not shown.]]

1) [[Parallelism|Psycho-physical parallelism]], or simply '''''parallelism''''', is the view that mind and body, while having distinct ontological statuses, do not causally influence one another. Instead, they run along parallel paths (mind events causally interact with mind events and brain events causally interact with brain events) and only '''seem''' to influence each other.<ref name=""DuSEP"">{{cite web

}} </ref>  This view was most prominently defended by [[Gottfried Leibniz]]. Although Leibniz was an ontological monist who believed that only one type of substance, the [[monad]], exists in the universe, and that everything is reducible to it, he nonetheless maintained that there was an important distinction between ""the mental"" and ""the physical"" in terms of causation. He held that God had arranged things in advance so that minds and bodies would be in harmony with each other. This is known as the doctrine of [[pre-established harmony]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Leibniz | first=Gottfried Wilhelm | title=Monadology | origyear=1714}}</ref>

[[Image:Gottfried_Wilhelm_von_Leibniz.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] by Bernhard Christoph Francke (circa 1700)]]

2) [[Occasionalism]] is the view espoused by [[Nicholas Malebranche]] which asserts that all supposedly causal relations between physical events, or between physical and mental events, are not really causal at all. While body and mind are different substances, causes (whether mental or physical) are related to their effects by an act of God's intervention on each specific occasion.<ref>{{cite web

3) [[Epiphenomenalism]] is a doctrine first formulated by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]].<ref> Huxley, T. H. [1874] ""On the Hypothesis that Animals are Automata, and its History"", ''The Fortnightly Review'', n.s.16:555-580. Reprinted in ''Method and Results: Essays by Thomas H. Huxley'' (New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1898).</ref> It consists in the view that mental phenomena are causally ineffectual. Physical events can cause other physical events and physical events can cause mental events, but mental events cannot cause anything, since they are just causally inert by-products (i.e. ''epiphenomena'') of the physical world.<ref name=""DuSEP"" /> This view has been defended most strongly in recent times by [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Jackson, Frank | title=What Mary didn't know | journal=Journal of Philosophy. | year=1986, |pages=291-295}}</ref>

4) [[Property dualism]] asserts that when matter is organized in the appropriate way (i.e. in the way that living human bodies are organized), mental properties emerge. Hence, it is a sub-branch of [[emergent materialism]].<ref name=""Du"" />  These emergent properties have an independent ontological status and cannot be reduced to, or explained in terms of, the physical substrate from which they emerge. This position is espoused by [[David Chalmers]] and has undergone something of a renaissance in recent years.<ref>{{cite book | last=Chalmers |first=David | title=The Conscious Mind | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1997 | id=ISBN 0-19-511789-1 }} </ref>

==Monist solutions to the mind-body problem==
[[Image:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|[[Baruch Spinoza|Baruch (de) Spinoza]]]]
In contrast to dualism, monism states that there is only one fundamental substance. Today, the most common forms of monism in Western philosophy are [[physicalism|physicalist]].<ref name=""Kim"" /> Physicalistic monism asserts that the only existing substance is physical, in some sense of that term to be clarified by our best science.<ref name=""Stol"">{{cite web

}}</ref> However, a variety of formulations are possible (see below). Another form of monism, [[idealism]], states that the only existing substance is mental. It is uncommon in contemporary Western Philosophy.<ref name=""Kim"" /> 

[[Phenomenalism]] is the theory that representations (or [[sense data]]) of external objects are all that exist. Such a view was briefly adopted by [[Bertrand Russell]] and many of the [[logical positivists]] during the early 20th century.<ref> Russell, Bertrand (1918) ''Mysticism and Logic and Other Essays'', London: Longmans, Green. </ref> A third possibility is to accept the existence of a basic substance which is neither physical nor mental. The mental and physical would then both be properties of this neutral substance. Such a position was adopted by [[Baruch Spinoza]]<ref name=""Spin"" /> and was popularized by [[Ernst Mach]]<ref> Mach, E. (1886) ''Die Analyse der Empfindungen und das Verhältnis des Physischen zum Psychischen.'' Fifth edition translated as ''The Analysis of Sensations and the Relation of Physical to the Psychical'', New York: Dover. 1959 </ref> in the 19th century. This [[neutral monism]], as it is called, resembles ''property dualism''. 

===Physicalistic Monisms===

===Behaviorism===
{{Main|Behaviorism}}
Behaviorism dominated philosophy of mind for much of the 20th century, especially the first half.<ref name=""Kim"" /> In psychology, behaviorism developed as a reaction to the inadequacies of [[introspection|introspectionism]].<ref name=""Stol"" /> Introspective reports on one's own interior mental life are not subject to careful examination for accuracy and can not be used to form predictive generalizations. Without generalizability and the possibility of third-person examination, the behaviorists argued, psychology cannot be scientific.<ref name=""Stol"" /> The way out, therefore, was to eliminate the idea of an interior mental life (and hence an ontologically independent mind) altogether and focus instead on the description of observable behavior.<ref> {{cite book | author=Skinner,B.F. | title=Beyond Freedom & Dignity | publisher=Bantam/Vintage Books |location=New York | year=1972}}</ref>

Parallel to these developments in psychology, a philosophical behaviorism (sometimes called ''logical behaviorism'') was developed.<ref name=""Stol"" /> This is characterized by a strong [[verificationism]], which generally considers unverifiable statements about interior mental life senseless. For the behaviorist, mental states are not interior states on which one can make introspective reports. They are just descriptions of behavior or [[disposition]]s to behave in certain ways, made by third parties to explain and predict others' behavior.<ref>{{cite book | author=Ryle, Gilbert | title=The Concept of Mind | year=1949 | publisher=Chicago University Press | location=Chicago | year=1949 |id=ISBN 0-226-73295-9 }}</ref>

Philosophical behaviorism, notably held by [[Wittgenstein]], has fallen out of favor since the latter half of the 20th century, coinciding with the rise of [[cognitivism]].<ref name=""Kim1"" /> Cognitivists reject behaviorism due to several perceived problems. For example, behaviorism could be said to be [[counter-intuitive]] when it maintains that someone is talking about behavior in the event that a person is experiencing a painful headache.

===Identity theory===
{{Main|Type physicalism}}
Type physicalism (or type-identity theory) was developed by [[J. J. C. Smart|John Smart]]<ref name=""Smart"" /> and [[Ullin Place]]<ref>{{cite journal | author=Place, Ullin | title=Is Consciousness a Brain Process? | journal=British Journal of Psychology | year=1956}}</ref> as a direct reaction to the failure of behaviorism. These philosophers reasoned that, if mental states are something material, but not behavior, then mental states are probably identical to internal states of the brain. In very simplified terms: a mental state ''M'' is nothing other than brain state ''B''. The mental state ""desire for a cup of coffee"" would thus be nothing more than the ""firing of certain neurons in certain brain regions"".<ref name=""Smart"" />
[[Image:Anomalous_Monism.png|thumb|right|250px|The classic Identity theory and Anomalous Monism in contrast. For the Identity theory, every token instantiation of a single mental type corresponds (as indicated by the arrows) to a physical token of a single physical type. For anomalous monism, the token-token correspondences can fall outside of the type-type correspondences. The result is token identity.]]

Despite initial plausibility, the identity theory faces at least one challenge in the form of the [[multiple realizability]] thesis , as first formulated by [[Hilary Putnam]].<ref name=""Pu"" />  It seems clear that not only humans, but also amphibians, for example, can experience pain. On the other hand, it seems very improbable that all of these diverse organisms with the same pain are in the same identical brain state. If this is not the case however, then pain cannot be identical to a certain brain state. The identity theory is thus empirically unfounded.<ref name=""Pu"" />

But, even if this is the case, it does not follow that identity theories of all types must be abandoned. According to ''token identity'' theories, the fact that a certain brain state is connected with only one ""mental"" state of a person does not have to mean that there is an absolute correlation between ''types'' of mental states and ''types'' of brain state. The ''type-token distinction'' can be illustrated by a simple example: the word ""green"" contains four types of letters (g, r, e, n) with two tokens (occurrences) of the letter ''e'' along with one each of the others.
The idea of ''token identity'' is that only particular ''occurrences'' of mental events are identical with particular ''occurrences'' or tokenings of physical events.<ref> Smart, J.J.C, ""Identity Theory"", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2002 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL=<http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2002/entries/malebranche/> </ref> Anomalous monism (see below) and most other ''non-reductive physicalisms'' are token-identity theories.<ref> {{cite book | author=Davidson, D.| title=Subjective, Intersubjective, Objective | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford | year=2001 | id=ISBN 88-7078-832-6 }}</ref> Despite these problems, there is a renewed interest in the type identity theory today, primarily due to the influence of [[Jaegwon Kim]].<ref name=""Smart"" />

===Functionalism===
{{Main|Functionalism (philosophy of mind)}}
Functionalism was formulated by [[Hilary Putnam]] and [[Jerry Fodor]] as a reaction to the inadequacies of the identity theory.<ref name=""Pu"" /> Putnam and Fodor saw mental states in terms of an empirical [[computational theory of mind|computational theory of the mind]].<ref name=""Block"">Block, Ned. ""What is functionalism"" in ''Readings in Philosophy of Psychology'', 2 vols. Vol 1. (Cambridge: Harvard, 1980).</ref> At about the same time or slightly after, [[D.M. Armstrong]] and [[David Kellogg Lewis]] formulated a version of functionalism which analyzed the mental concepts of folk psychology in terms of functional roles.<ref> Armstrong, D., 1968, ''A Materialist Theory of the Mind'', Routledge. </ref> Finally, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'s idea of meaning as use led to a version of functionalism as a theory of meaning, further developed by [[Wilfrid Sellars]] and [[Gilbert Harman]].

What all these different varieties of functionalism share in common is the thesis that mental states are characterized by their causal relations with other mental states and with sensory inputs and behavioral outputs. That is, functionalism abstracts away from the details of the physical implementation of a mental state by characterizing it in terms of non-mental ''functional'' properties. For example, a kidney is characterized scientifically by its functional role in filtering blood and maintaining certain chemical balances. From this point of view, it does not really matter whether the kidney be made up of organic tissue, plastic nanotubes or silicon chips: it is the role that it plays and its relations to other organs that define it as a kidney.<ref name=""Block"" />

===Nonreductive physicalism===
Many philosophers hold firmly to two essential convictions with regard to mind-body relations: 1) Physicalism is true and mental states must be physical states, and 2) All reductionist proposals are unsatisfactory: mental states cannot be reduced to behavior, brain states or functional states.<ref name=""Stol"" /> Hence, the question arises whether there can still be a non-reductive physicalism. [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]'s [[anomalous monism]]<ref name=""Davidson"" /> is an attempt to formulate such a physicalism.

The idea is often formulated in terms of the thesis of [[supervenience]]: mental states supervene on physical states, but are not reducible to them. ""Supervenience"" therefore describes a functional dependence: there can be no change in the mental without some change in the physical.<ref>Stanton, W.L. (1983) ""Supervenience and Psychological Law in Anomalous Monism"", ''Pacific Philosophical Quarterly'' 64: 72-9 </ref>

===Eliminative materialism===
{{Main|Eliminative materialism}}
If one is a materialist but believes that all reductive efforts have failed and that a non-reductive materialism is incoherent, then one can adopt a final, more radical position: eliminative materialism. Eliminative materialists maintain that mental states are fictitious entities introduced by everyday ""[[folk psychology]]"".<ref name=""Pat"" /> Should ""folk psychology"", which eliminativists view as a quasi-scientific theory, be proven wrong in the course of scientific development, then we must also abolish all of the entities postulated by it.

Eliminativists such as [[Patricia Churchland|Patricia]] and [[Paul Churchland]] often invoke the fate of other, erroneous popular theories and [[ontology|ontologies]] which have arisen in the course of history.<ref name=""Pat"" /><ref name=""Paul"" />  For example, the belief in [[witchcraft]] as a cause of people's problems turned out to be wrong and the consequence is that most people no longer believe in the existence of witches. Witchcraft is not ''explained'' in terms of some other phenomenon, but rather ''eliminated'' from the discourse.<ref name=""Paul"" />

==Linguistic criticism of the mind-body problem==
Each attempt to answer the mind-body problem encounters substantial problems. Some philosophers argue that this is because there is an underlying conceptual confusion.<ref name=""Hacker"">{{cite book | author=Hacker, Peter | title=Philosophical Foundations of Neuroscience | publisher=Blackwel Pub. | year=2003 | id=ISBN 1-4051-0838-X }}</ref>  These philosophers, such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and his followers in the tradition of linguistic criticism, therefore reject the problem as illusory.<ref name=""Witt"">{{cite book | author=Wittgenstein, Ludwig | title=Philosophical Investigations | publisher=Macmillan | location=New York | year=1954}}</ref> They argue that it is an error to ask how mental and biological states fit together. Rather it should simply be accepted that human experience can be described in different ways - for instance, in a mental and in a biological vocabulary. Illusory problems arise if one tries to describe the one in terms of the other's vocabulary or if the mental vocabulary is used in the wrong contexts.<ref name=""Witt"" /> This is the case, for instance, if one searches for mental states of the brain. The brain is simply the wrong context for the use of mental vocabulary - the search for mental states of the brain is therefore a [[category error]] or a sort of fallacy of reasoning.<ref name=""Witt"" />

Today, such a position is often adopted by interpreters of Wittgenstein such as [[Peter Hacker]].<ref name=""Hacker"" /> However, [[Hilary Putnam]], the inventor of functionalism, has also adopted the position that the mind-body problem is an illusory problem which should be dissolved according to the manner of Wittgenstein.<ref>{{cite book | author=Putnam, Hilary | title=The Threefold Cord: Mind, Body, and World | publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York | year=2000 |id=ISBN 0-231-10286-0 }}</ref>

==Naturalism and its problems==
The thesis of physicalism is that the mind is part of the material (or ''physical'') world. Such a position faces the fundamental problem that the mind has certain properties that no material thing possesses. Physicalism must therefore explain how it is possible that these properties can emerge from a material thing nevertheless. The project of providing such an explanation is often referred to as the ""[[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalization]] of the mental.""<ref name=""Stol"" />  What are the crucial problems that this project must attempt to resolve? The most well-known are probably the following two:<ref name=""Stol"" />

===Qualia===
{{Main|Qualia}}
Many mental states have the property of being experienced subjectively in different ways by different individuals.<ref name=""Nagel"" /> For example, it is obviously characteristic of the mental state of ''pain'' that it hurts. Moreover, your sensation of pain may not be identical to mine, since we have no way of measuring how much something hurts nor of describing exactly ''how it feels to hurt''. Where does such an experience (quale) come from? Nothing indicates that a neural or functional state can be accompanied by such a pain experience. Often the point is formulated as follows: the existence of cerebral events, in and of themselves, cannot explain why they are accompanied by these corresponding qualitative experiences. Why do many cerebral processes occur with an accompanying experiential aspect in consciousness? It seems impossible to explain.<ref name=""Ja"" />

Yet it also seems to many that science will eventually have to explain such experiences.<ref name=""Stol"" /> This follows from the logic of reductive [[explanation]]s. If I try to explain a [[phenomenon]] reductively (e.g., [[water]]), I also have to explain why the phenomenon has all of the properties that it has (e.g., fluidity, transparency).<ref name=""Stol"" />In the case of mental states, this means that there needs to be an explanation of why they have the property of being experienced in a certain way.

The problem of explaining the introspective, first-person experiential aspects of mental states, and consciousness in general, in terms of third-person quantitative neuroscience is called the ''[[explanatory gap]]''.<ref>Joseph Levine, ''Materialism and Qualia: The Explanatory Gap'', in: ''Pacific Philosophical Quarterly'', vol. 64, no. 4, October, 1983, 354 - 361</ref> There are several different views of the nature of this gap among contemporary philosophers of mind. [[David Chalmers]] and the early [[Frank Jackson]] interpret the gap as [[ontology|ontological]] in nature; that is, they maintain that qualia can never be explained by science because physicalism is false. There are two separate categories involved and one cannot be reduced to the other.<ref>Jackson, F. (1986) ""What Mary didn't Know"", Journal of Philosophy, 83, 5, pp. 291-295.</ref> An alternative view is taken by philosophers such as [[Thomas Nagel]] and [[Colin McGinn]]. According to them, the gap is [[epistemology|epistemological]] in nature. For Nagel, science is not yet able to explain subjective experience  because it has not yet arrived at the level or kind of knowledge that is required. We are not even able to formulate the problem coherently.<ref name=""Nagel"" /> For McGinn, on other hand, the problem is one of permanent and inherent biological limitations. We are not able to resolve the explanatory gap because the realm of subjective experiences is cognitively closed to us in the same manner that quantum physics is cognitively closed to elephants.<ref>McGinn, C. ""Can the Mind-Body Problem Be Solved"", ''Mind'', New Series, Volume 98, Issue 391, pp. 349-366. a[[http://art-mind.org/review/IMG/pdf/McGinn_1989_Mind-body-problem_M.pdf (online)]]</ref> Other philosophers liquidate the gap as purely a semantic problem.

===Intentionality===
[[Image:John Searle 2002.jpg|thumb|[[John Searle]] - one of the most influential philosophers of mind, proponent of [[biological naturalism]] (Berkeley 2002)]]
[[Intentionality]] is the capacity of mental states to be directed towards (''about'') or be in relation with something in the external world.<ref name=""Searleint"" /> This property of mental states entails that they have [[mental content|contents]] and [[semantics|semantic referents]] and can therefore be assigned truth values. When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem: natural processes are not true or false, they simply happen.<ref>{{cite book | author=Fodor,Jerry | title=Psychosemantics. The problem of meaning in the philosophy of mind | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge | year=1993 | id=ISBN 0-262-06106-6 }}</ref> It would not make any sense to say that a natural process is true or false. But mental ideas or judgments are true or false, so how then can mental states (ideas or judgments) be natural processes? The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that [[Herodotus]] was a historian refers to Herodotus and to the fact that he was an historian. If the fact is true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false. But where does this relation come from? In the brain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have anything to do with Herodotus.<ref name=""Int"" />

==Philosophy of mind and science==
Humans are corporeal beings and, as such, they are subject to examination and description by the natural sciences. Since mental processes are not independent of bodily processes, the descriptions that the natural sciences furnish of human beings play an important role in the philosophy of mind.<ref name=""Kim1"" />  There are many scientific disciplines that study processes related to the mental. The list of such sciences includes: [[biology]], [[computer science]], [[cognitive science]], [[cybernetics]], [[linguistics]], [[medicine]], [[pharmacology]], [[psychology]], etc.<ref name=""Pinker"">Pinker, S. (1997) ''How the Mind Works''. tr. It: ''Come Funziona la Mente''. Milan:Mondadori, 2000. ISBN 88-04-49908-7 </ref>

===Neurobiology===
The theoretical background of biology, as is the case with modern [[natural science]]s in general, is fundamentally materialistic. The objects of study are, in the first place, physical processes, which are considered to be the foundations of mental activity and behavior.<ref name=""Bear"">Bear, M. F. et. al. Eds. (1995). ''Neuroscience: Exploring The Brain''. Baltimore, Maryland, Williams and Wilkins. ISBN 0-7817-3944-6 </ref> The increasing success of biology in the explanation of mental phenomena can be seen by the absence of any empirical refutation of its fundamental presupposition: ""there can be no change in the mental states of a person without a change in brain states.""<ref name=""Pinker"" />

Within the field of [[neurobiology]], there are many subdisciplines which are concerned with the relations between mental and physical states and processes:<ref name=""Bear"" /> [[Neurophysiology|Sensory neurophysiology]] investigates the relation between the processes of [[perception]] and [[stimulation]].<ref name=""Pinel"">{{cite book | author=Pinel, J.P.J | title=Psychobiology | publisher=Prentice Hall | year=1997 | id=ISBN 88-15-07174-1 }}</ref> [[Cognitive neuroscience]] studies the correlations between mental processes and neural processes.<ref name=""Pinel"" /> [[Neuropsychology]] describes the dependence of mental faculties on specific anatomical regions of the brain.<ref name=""Pinel"" /> Lastly, [[evolutionary biology]] studies the origins and development of the human nervous system and, in as much as this is the basis of the mind, also describes the [[ontogenesis|ontogenetic]] and [[phylogenesis|phylogenetic]] development of mental phenomena beginning from their most primitive stages.<ref name=""Pinker"" />
[[Image:FMRI.jpg|thumb|Since the 1980's, sophisticated [[neuroimaging]] procedures, such as [[fMRI]] (above), have furnished increasing knowledge about the workings of the human brain, shedding light on ancient philosophical problems.]]

The [[methodology|methodological]] breakthroughs of the neurosciences, in particular the introduction of high-tech [[neuroimaging|neuroimaging procedure]]s, has propelled scientists toward the elaboration of increasingly ambitious research programs: one of the main goals is to describe and comprehend the neural processes which correspond to mental functions (see: [[neural correlate]]).<ref name=""Bear"" /> A very small number of neurobiologists, such as [[Emil du Bois-Reymond]] and [[John Carew Eccles]] have denied the possibility of a ""reduction"" of mental phenomena to cerebral processes, partly for [[religion|religious]] reasons.<ref name=""PopE"" /> However, the contemporary neurobiologist and philosopher [[Gerhard Roth (biologist)|Gerhard Roth]] continues to defend a form of ""non-reductive materialism.""<ref>{{cite book | author=Roth, Gerhard | title=The brain and its reality. Cognitive Neurobiology and its philosophical consequences | publisher=Aufl. Suhrkamp |location=Frankfurt a.M. | year=2001 | id=ISBN 3-518-58183-X }}</ref>

===Computer science===
[[Computer science]] concerns itself with the automatic processing of [[information]] (or at least with physical systems of symbols to which information is assigned) by means of such things as [[computer]]s.<ref>{{cite book | author=Sipser, M.| title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation | location=Boston, Mass. | publisher=PWS Publishing Co. | id=ISBN 0-534-94728-X}}</ref> From the beginning, [[computer programmer]]s have been able to develop programs which permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic beings need a ''mind''. A simple example is multiplication. But it is clear that computers do not use a mind to multiply. Could they, someday, come to have what we call a mind? This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of [[artificial intelligence]] (""AI"").

Within AI, it is common to distinguish between a modest research program and a more ambitious one: this distinction was coined by [[John Searle]] in terms of a [[weak AI]] and a [[strong AI]]. The exclusive objective of ""weak AI"", according to Searle, is the successful simulation of mental states, with no attempt to make computers become conscious or aware, etc. The objective of strong AI, on the contrary, is a computer with consciousness similar to that of human beings.<ref name=""Searle"">{{cite journal | author=Searle, John | title=Minds, Brains and Programs | journal=The Behavioral and Brain Sciences | Issue=3 | pages=417-424 |year=1980}}</ref>  The program of strong AI goes back to one of the pioneers of computation [[Alan Turing]]. As an answer to the question ""Can computers think?"", he formulated the famous [[Turing test]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Turing, Alan | title=Computing machinery and intelligence | year=1950}}</ref>  Turing believed that a computer could be said to ""think"" when, if placed in a room by itself next to another room which contained a human being and with the same questions being asked of both the computer and the human being by a third party human being, the computer's responses turned out to be indistinguishable from those of the human. Essentially, Turing's view of machine intelligence followed the behaviourist model of the mind - intelligence ''is'' as intelligence does.  The Turing test has received many criticisms, among which the most famous is probably the [[Chinese room]] [[thought experiment]] formulated by Searle.<ref name=""Searle"" />

The question about the possible sensitivity ([[qualia]]) of computers or robots still remains open. Some computer scientists believe that the specialty of AI can still make new contributions to the resolution of the ""mind body problem"". They suggest that based on the reciprocal influences between software and hardware that takes place in all computers, it is possible that someday theories can be discovered that help us to understand the reciprocal influences between the human mind and the brain ([[wetware]]).<ref> {{cite book | author=Russell, S. and Norvig, R. | title=Artificial Intelligence:A Modern Approach | location=New Jersey | publisher=Prentice Hall, Inc. | year=1995 | id=ISBN 0-13-103805-2 }}</ref>

===Psychology===
[[Psychology]] is the science that investigates mental states directly. It uses generally empirical methods to investigate concrete mental states like [[joy]], [[fear]] or [[Obsessive-compulsive disorder|obsession]]s. Psychology investigates the laws that bind these mental states to each other or with [[input]]s and [[output]]s to the human organism.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.psychology.org | title=Encyclopedia of Psychology}}</ref>

An example of this is the [[Perception|psychology of perception]]. Scientists working in this field have discovered general principles of the [[perception of forms]]. A law of the psychology of forms says that objects that move in the same direction are perceived as related to each other.<ref name=""Pinker"" /> This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest anything about the ''nature'' of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mind-body problem already described.

==Philosophy of mind in the continental tradition==
Most of the discussion in this article has focused on the predominant ''school'' (or ''style'') of philosophy in modern Western culture, usually called [[analytic philosophy]] (sometimes also inaccurately described as ''Anglo-American'' philosophy).<ref name=""Dummett"">{{cite book | author=Dummett, M.| title=Origini della Filosofia Analitica | publisher=Einaudi | year=2001 | id=ISBN 88-06-15286-6 }}</ref> Other schools of thought exist, however, which are sometimes (also misleadingly) subsumed under the broad label of [[continental philosophy]].<ref name=""Dummett"" />  In any case, the various schools that fall under this label ([[phenomenology]], [[existentialism]], etc.) tend to differ from the analytic school in that they focus less on language and logical analysis and more on directly understanding human existence and experience. With reference specifically to the discussion of the ''mind'', this tends to translate into attempts to grasp the concepts of [[thought]] and [[experience|perceptual experience]] in some direct sense that does not involve the analysis of linguistic forms.<ref name=""Dummett"" />

In [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s ''Phenomenology of Mind'', Hegel discusses three distinct types of mind: the ''subjective mind'', the mind of an individual; the ''objective mind'', the mind of society and of the State; and the ''Absolute mind'', a unity of all concepts. See also Hegel's ''Philosophy of Mind'' from his ''Encyclopedia''.<ref>{{cite book | author=Hegel,G.W.F | title=Phenomenology of Spirit}}, translated by A.V.

In modern times, the two main schools that have developed in response or opposition to this Hegelian tradition are ''Phenomenology'' and ''Existentialism''. Phenomenology, founded by [[Edmund Husserl]], focuses on the contents of the human mind (see [[noema]]) and how phenomenological processes shape our experiences.<ref>{{cite book | author=Husserl,Edmund | title=Logische Untersuchungen}} trans.: Giovanni Piana. Milan: EST. ISBN 88-428-0949-7 </ref> [[Existentialism]], a school of thought founded upon the work of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], focuses on the content of experiences and how the mind deals with such experiences.<ref>Flynn, Thomas, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2004/entries/sartre/ ""Jean-Paul Sartre""], ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2004 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)</ref>

An important, though not very well known, example of a philosopher of mind and cognitive scientist who tries to synthesize ideas from both traditions is [[Ron McClamrock]]. Borrowing from [[Herbert Simon]] and also influenced by the ideas of [[existential phenomenology|existential phenomenologists]] such as [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[Martin Heidegger]], McClamrock suggests that man's condition of being-in-the-world (""Dasein"", ""In-der-welt-sein"") makes it impossible for him to understand himself by abstracting away from it and examining it as if it were a detached experimental object of which he himself is not an integral part.<ref>{{cite book | author=McClamrock, Ron | title=Existential Cognition: Computational Minds in the World | location=Chicago | publisher=University of Chicago Press | year=1995}}</ref>

==Consequences of philosophy of mind==
There are countless subjects that are affected by the ideas developed in the philosophy of mind. Clear examples of this are the nature of [[death]] and its definitive character, the nature of [[emotion]], of [[perception]] and of [[memory]]. Questions about what a [[person]] is and what his or her [[Personal identity|identity]] consists of also have much to do with the philosophy of mind. There are two subjects that, in connection with the philosophy of the mind, have aroused special attention: [[free will]] and the [[self]].<ref name=""Kim1"" />

===Free will===
{{Main| Free will}}
In the context of the philosophy of mind, the problem of free will takes on a renewed intensity. This is certainly the case, at least, for materialistic [[determinism|determinists]].<ref name=""Kim1"" />  According to this position, natural laws completely determine the course of the material world. Mental states, and therefore the ''will'' as well, would be material states, which means human behavior and decisions would be completely determined by natural laws. Some take this reasoning a step further: people cannot determine by themselves what they want and what they do. Consequently, they are not free.<ref name=""Hond"">{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwIntroIndex.htm |title=Philosopher Ted Honderich's Determinism web resource}}</ref>

[[Image:Immanuel_Kant.jpg|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]] rejected compatibilism]]

This argumentation is rejected, on the one hand, by the [[compatibilism|compatibilists]]. Those who adopt this position suggest that the question ""Are we free?"" can only be answered once we have determined what the term ""free"" means. The opposite of ""free"" is not ""caused"" but ""compelled"" or ""coerced"". It is not appropriate to identify freedom with indetermination. A free act is one where the agent ''could'' have done otherwise ''if'' it had chosen otherwise. In this sense a person can be free even though determinism is true.<ref name=""Hond"" />  The most important compatibilist in the history of the philosophy was [[David Hume]].<ref>Russell, Paul, ''Freedom and Moral Sentiment: Hume's Way of Naturalizing Responsibility'' Oxford University Press: New York & Oxford, 1995. </ref>Nowadays, this position is defended, for example, by [[Daniel Dennett]],<ref>{{cite book| author=Dennett, Daniel | title=The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting | publisher=Bradford Books-MIT Press |location=Cambridge MA | year=1984 |id=ISBN 0-262-54042-8 }}</ref> and, from a dual-aspect perspective, by [[Max Velmans]].<ref>{{cite book| author=Velmans, Max | title=How could conscious experiences affect brains? | publisher=Imprint Academic | location=Exeter | year=2003 |id=ISBN 0907845-39-8 }}</ref>


On the other hand, there are also many [[incompatibilism|incompatibilists]] who reject the argument because they believe that the will is free in a stronger sense called [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|originationism]].<ref name=""Hond"" />  These philosophers affirm that the course of the world is not completely determined by natural laws: the will at least does not have to be and, therefore, it is potentially free. The most prominent incompatibilist in the history of philosophy was [[Immanuel Kant]].<ref>{{cite book| author=Kant, Immanuel | title=Critique of Pure Reason | year=1781}} translation: F. Max Muller, Dolphin Books, Doubleday & Co. Garden City, New York. 1961.</ref> Critics of this position accuse the incompatibilists of using an incoherent concept of freedom. They argue as follows: if our will is not determined by anything, then we desire what we desire by pure chance. And if what we desire is purely accidental, we are not free. So if our will is not determined by anything, we are not free.<ref name=""Hond"" />

===The self===
The philosophy of mind also has important consequences for the concept of [[self]]. If by ""self"" or ""I"" one refers to an essential, immutable nucleus of the ''person'', most modern philosophers of mind will affirm that no such thing exists.<ref name=""DHof"">{{cite book | author=Dennett, C. and Hofstadter, D.R. | title=The Mind's I | publisher=Bantam Books | year=1981 |id=ISBN 0-553-01412-9}}</ref>  The idea of a self as an immutable essential nucleus derives from the Christian idea of an [[soul|immaterial soul]]. Such an idea is unacceptable to most contemporary philosophers, due to their physicalistic orientations, and due to a general acceptance among philosophers of the scepticism of the concept of 'self' by [[David Hume]], who could never catch ''himself'' doing, thinking or feeling anything.<ref>{{cite book | author=Searle, John | title=Mind: A Brief Introduction  | publisher=Oxford University Press Inc, USA   | year=Jan 2005|id=ISBN 0-19-515733-8 }}</ref>  However, in the light of empirical results from [[developmental psychology]], [[developmental biology]] and the [[neuroscience]]s, the idea of an essential ''inconstant'', ''material'' nucleus - an integrated representational system distributed over changing patterns of synaptic connections - seems reasonable.<ref>{{cite book | author=LeDoux,Joseph | title=The Synaptic Self | location=New York | publisher=Viking Penguin | year=2002 | id=ISBN 88-7078-795-8 }}</ref>

In view of this problem, some philosophers affirm that we should abandon the idea of a self.<ref name=""DHof"" /> For example, [[Thomas Metzinger]] and [[Susan Blackmore]] both practice meditation, claiming that this gives us reliable conscious experience of selflessness.<ref>{{cite book | author=Blackmore, Susan | title=Conversations on Consciousness: Interviews with Twenty Minds  | publisher= Oxford University Press  | year=Nov 2005|id=ISBN 0-19-280622-X }}</ref> Philosophers and scientists holding this view frequently talk of the self, ""I"", agency and related concepts as 'illusory', a view with parallels in some Eastern religious traditions, such as [[anatta]] in [[Buddhism]].<ref>{{cite book 
 | last = Lopez Jr.
 | first = Donald S.
 | title = Buddhism in Practice
 | year = 1995
 | publisher = Princeton University Press
 | location = Princeton
 | id = ISBN 0-691-04441-4
 }}</ref> But this is a minority position. More common is the view that we should redefine the concept: by ""self"" we would not be referring to some immutable and essential nucleus, but to something that is in permanent change. A contemporary defender of this position is [[Daniel Dennett]].<ref name=""DHof"" />

'''Playtex''' is a product brand owned by Playtex Marketing Corp. and leased to several companies that sell Playtex-branded products. [[Sara Lee Corporation|Sara Lee]] has exclusive rights to the Playtex brand for bras, panties and [[Foundation garment|shapewear]] in Europe and South Africa, while a [[HanesBrands]] subsidiary sells Playtex apparel in the rest of the world. Playtex Products LLC, which is owned by Energizer Holdings, sells Playtex-branded baby cups, gloves, [[tampon]]s and other consumer products. Prior to 1988 all Playtex-branded products were sold by a single company.

Playtex was founded as International Latex Corporation (ILC), which started out making infants' [[rubber pants]] in the 1930s, before expanding into women's girdles. After World War II, ILC resumed production and created Playtex as one of four divisions. Playtex established the use of standard sizes for undergarments, while previously they were custom-tailored. The company was the first to advertise undergarments on national television in 1955. Twenty-two years later, it was also the first to take advantage of relaxed regulations by the [[National Association of Broadcasters]], when it showed a live model wearing a bra in a commercial. 

During the 1960s, [[tampon]]s and infant-care products bearing the Playtex brand were introduced, making Playtex the primary competitor to [[Tampax]] in the tampon [[Economic sector|sector]]. Playtex also introduced the plastic tampon applicator. In 1962, before Playtex's industrial division spun-off into [[ILC Dover]], it helped create the latex components of the spacesuits used in the Apollo mission. From 1969 to the 1990s, [[chief executive officer]] Joel Smilow led the company through a series of acquisitions and sales. Playtex was acquired by [[Esmark]] in 1975, and then by [[Beatrice Foods]] in 1985. A year later an investor group led by Smilow bought Playtex for $1.25 billion. Its cosmetics brands were sold to [[Revlon]] to fund the acquisition.

In 1988, Smilow split Playtex into two companies in a $1.3 billion transaction that bought out some of Playtex's other investors and put ownership into two separate investment firms operated by Smilow. In 1991, Playtex Apparel Inc., was sold to [[Sara Lee Corporation]], which became part of [[Energizer Holdings]] in 2007. Several of Sara Lee's brands, including Playtex Apparel, were spun-off into [[HanesBrands]].

[[File:Playtex living girdle ad.jpg|thumb|left|A woman leaping while wearing a 1940s latex girdle]]

===Recent history===

Playtex Products continued to erode Tampax's' [[market share]] throughout the late 20th century. The two companies had divided the market almost evenly by the late 1990s.<ref name=Focus>{{cite book|last=Ries|first=Al|title=Focus: The Future of Your Company Depends on It|year=2005|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=9780060799908|page=223|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LkB21Vc30XUC&pg=PA223|accessdate=May 1, 2013}}</ref> Both makers increased profits primarily by reducing the tampon count per box, and prepared to enter [[emerging markets]], particularly in Asia, where many women still used homemade pads. In 1997 [[Procter & Gamble]] (P&G), makers of [[Always (brand)|Always]] [[sanitary napkins]] and [[pantiliner]]s, bought Tambrands for $1.25 billion, its largest acquisition up to that point, returning to the tampon sector almost two decades after pulling [[Rely (brand)|Rely]] from the market over Toxic Shock Syndrome concerns.<ref name=""Houppert The Curse"">{{cite book|last=Houppert|first=Karen|title=The Curse: Confronting the Last Unmentionable Taboo: Menstruation|year=2000|publisher=MacMillan|isbn=9781466813960|pages=39–43|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6IlCwf5BgJ0C&pg=PA39}}</ref>

Due to its strong advantage among younger women, and [[baby boomer]]s reaching [[menopause]], Playtex continued to gain market share on Tampax. After extensive [[market research]], Tampax reversed that trend with the 2002 introduction of Pearl, with an applicator designed to be as visually appealing as it was functional, and making the brand once again appealing to teens.<ref name=""The Game Changer"">{{cite book|title=The Game Changer: How Every Leader Can Drive Everyday Innovation|publisher=Profile Books|isbn=9781847651365|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=auCt2-LPnLkC&pg=PA1975|author=Lafley, A.G.|coauthors=Sharan, Ram|accessdate=May 1, 2013}}</ref>  

Playtex responded by [[litigation|litigating]]. In one suit, it alleged [[patent infringement]] over Pearl's applicator design.<ref name=""Patent infringment suits"">Defendant's motion for [[summary judgement]] granted, ''[http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6484296561260996706 Playtex Products Inc. v.

'''Hillel Slovak''' (April 13, 1962&ndash;June 25, 1988) was an Israeli-American musician best known as the original guitarist and founding member of the [[Los Angeles]] rock band [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]. Prior to his death of a heroin overdose in 1988, Slovak recorded two albums with the band, ''[[Freaky Styley]]'' (1985) and ''[[The Uplift Mofo Party Plan]]'' (1987).

==Biography==
===Early years===
Slovak was born in [[Haifa]], [[Israel]] to [[Jewish People|Jewish]] parents who were survivors of the [[Holocaust]]. His mother was of [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish]] descent and his father of [[Yugoslavia]]n descent. The family emigrated to the [[United States|U.S.]] when Hillel was four.  They settled in [[Queens]], [[New York]], then in 1967 relocated to [[Southern California]]. Slovak attended Bancroft Jr. High School in [[Hollywood]], where he met future bandmates [[Jack Irons]] and [[Flea (musician)|Michael ""Flea"" Balzary]]. The three then attended [[Fairfax High School (Los Angeles)|Fairfax High School]]. While at Fairfax, Slovak learned how to play guitar.  He, Irons, and Balzary, whom he introduced to rock music, met future bandmate [[Anthony Kiedis]]. Slovak formed a band with Irons on drums and two other high school friends, [[Alain Johannes]] and Todd Strasman. They called their band [[Chain Reaction (band)|Chain Reaction]], then changed the name to [[What Is This?|Anthym]] after their first gig. Slovak became dissatisfied with Strasman's bass playing and eventually taught Balzary to play bass. Balzary quickly took over bass duties in Anthym.

After graduating from high school, the band changed their name to [[What Is This?]]. Balzary left Anthym around this time to accept an offer of playing bass in the prominent L.A. punk band [[Fear (band)|Fear]]. What Is This? continued on and performed many shows along the [[California]] coast.

===Red Hot Chili Peppers===
One night, Kiedis' friend Gary Allen suggested that Kiedis, Slovak, and Balzary form a ""one-off"" band and open for his own band. For the gig, they enlisted Irons as their drummer and wrote the song ""Out in LA"". They dubbed themselves ""Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem"". They were a hit with the club audience and the owner asked them to come back the next week.
[[Image:EarlyRHCP.jpg|220px|thumb|left|Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1988 during the ''Uplift Mofo Party Plan'' tour; (left to right) [[Jack Irons]], [[Flea (musician)|Flea]], [[Anthony Kiedis]], Hillel Slovak]]
The band changed their name to [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], and Kiedis began writing more lyrics. The lyrics would eventually become songs such as ""Green Heaven"" and ""[[True Men Don't Kill Coyotes]]"".  Over the course of the next six months, the Red Hot Chili Peppers played many shows in L.A. clubs and became something of an underground hit. They scored a record deal with [[EMI]] only six months after the band was formed, and were set to record their first album. Balzary left Fear to pursue the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Unfortunately, What Is This? had also gotten a record deal. Since Slovak considered the Chili Peppers to merely be a side project and not a serious commitment, he left them to concentrate on What Is This?

During the recording of the second What Is This? album, Slovak became frustrated with the band. He contacted Balzary about rejoining the Red Hot Chili Peppers. This came at an opportune time, as Kiedis and Balzary were both dissatisfied with Slovak's replacement, [[Jack Sherman (guitarist)|Jack Sherman]]. After the culmination of the promotional tour for their first album, Sherman was fired and Slovak rejoined the band.

Slovak returned to the Chili Peppers for their second and third albums, ''[[Freaky Styley]]'' and ''[[The Uplift Mofo Party Plan]]''. The songs ""Skinny Sweaty Man"", ""Me and My Friends"", ""No Chump Love Sucker"" and probably ""Savior"" from the latter album were written about Slovak. He was nicknamed ""Slim Bob Billy"", ""Slim"", or ""Huckleberry"", and throughout the albums Kiedis calls him by these nicknames before he starts a guitar solo.
Slovak was mentioned many times in Kiedis' autobiography 'Scar Tissue'. Mr Kiedis talks fondly of his memories of his good friend.

===Death===
Slovak and Kiedis became addicted to [[heroin]] early in their careers. Deciding to give sobriety a chance, both Kiedis and Hillel stopped using prior to their European tour in support of ''The Uplift Mofo Party Plan''. During the tour both Kiedis and Hillel experienced intense heroin withdrawal - Hillel seemingly much more unstable than Kiedis - and upon returning home they both resumed their addictions. Little is known about his life the weeks following the tour, aside from a phone call to his brother.

Slovak was found dead due to a [[Speedball (drug)]] overdose on [[June 25]], [[1988]], shortly after the band returned from the European tour. He is interred at [[Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Hollywood Hills]], [[California]].

His last recording, a cover version of the [[Jimi Hendrix]] song ""[[Fire (Hendrix song)|Fire]]"", would later appear in the ''[[Abbey Road EP]]'' and album ''[[Mothers Milk]]''.

==Legacy==
Slovak's work was one of the major contributing factors to the Red Hot Chili Peppers' early sound. He was also a huge influence on a young [[John Frusciante]], who would later replace him as guitarist in the band. Frusciante based a lot of his playing style on Slovak's work. The songs ""[[Knock Me Down]]"" (from ''[[Mother's Milk]]'') and ""My Lovely Man"" (from ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'') were written as tributes to Hillel.

In 1999, a book titled ""Behind the Sun: The Diary & Art of Hillel Slovak"" was published. The book was authored by Slovak's brother James Slovak and features writings from his brother's diaries, paintings, photos and hand written notes from Kiedis and Balzary.

The '''SS ''Edmund Fitzgerald''''' was an American [[lake freighter|Great Lakes freighter]] that made headlines after sinking in a [[Lake Superior]] storm on November&nbsp;10, 1975, with the loss of the entire crew. When launched on June&nbsp;8, 1958, she was the largest boat on the [[Great Lakes]], and remains the largest boat to have sunk there. Nicknamed the ""Mighty Fitz"", ""Fitz"", or ""Big Fitz"", the ship suffered a series of mishaps during her launch: it took three attempts to break the champagne bottle used to christen her and she collided with a pier when she entered the water.

For seventeen&nbsp;years the ''Fitzgerald'' carried [[taconite]] from mines near [[Duluth, Minnesota]], to iron works in [[Detroit]], [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] and other ports. As a ""workhorse"" she set seasonal haul records six different times, often beating her own previous record.<ref name=""Thompson 1994, p. 164""/><ref name=""Kantar, p. 9"">[[#refKantar2006|Kantar (1998)]], p. 9.</ref>  Her size, record-breaking performance, and ""dee jay captain"" endeared the ''Fitzgerald'' to boat watchers. Captain Peter Pulcer was known for piping music day or night over the ship's intercom system while passing through the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers, and entertaining spectators at the [[Soo Locks]] with a running commentary about the ''Fitzgerald''.

With Captain Ernest M. McSorley in command and carrying a full cargo of taconite ore pellets, the ''Fitzgerald'' embarked on her final voyage from Superior, Wisconsin, on the afternoon of November&nbsp;9, 1975. En route to a steel mill near Detroit, Michigan, she joined a second freighter, the [[SS Arthur M. Anderson|SS ''Arthur M. Anderson'']]. By the next day the two ships were caught in the midst of a massive winter storm, with near [[Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale|hurricane-force]] winds and waves up to {{convert|35|ft}} high. Shortly after 7:10&nbsp;p.m. the ''Fitzgerald'' suddenly sank in Canadian waters approximately {{convert|17|mi|nmi km|abbr=none|sp=us}} from the entrance to [[Whitefish Bay]], at a depth of {{convert|530|ft}}. Although the ''Fitzgerald'' had reported being in difficulty earlier, no distress signals were sent before she sank. Her crew of 29&nbsp;perished and no bodies were recovered.

Many theories, books, studies and expeditions have examined the cause of the sinking. ''Fitzgerald'' may have fallen victim to the high waves of the storm, suffered structural failure, been swamped with water entering through her cargo hatches or deck, experienced topside damage or [[shoal]]ed in a shallow part of Lake Superior. Investigations into the sinking led to changes in Great Lakes shipping regulations and practices that included mandatory survival suits, depth finders, positioning systems, increased freeboard, and more frequent inspection of vessels. The sinking of the ''Edmund Fitzgerald'' is one of the most well-known disasters in the history of Great Lakes shipping. [[Gordon Lightfoot]] made her the subject of his 1976&nbsp;hit song, ""[[The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald|The Wreck of the ''Edmund Fitzgerald'']]"".

==History==
===Design and construction===

[[Northwestern Mutual Financial Network|Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company]] of [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], invested in the iron and minerals industries on a large-scale basis, including the construction of the ''Fitzgerald'', which represented the first such investment by any American life insurance company.<ref name=""Schumacher, p. 14"">[[#refSchumacher2005|Schumacher (2005)]], p. 14.</ref> In 1957, they contracted [[Great Lakes Engineering Works]] (GLEW), of [[River Rouge, Michigan]], to design and construct the ship ""within a foot of the maximum length allowed for passage through the soon-to-be completed Saint Lawrence Seaway.""<ref name=""MacInnis, p. 20"">[[#refMacInnis|MacInnis (1998)]], p. 20.</ref> The ''Fitzgerald'' was the first [[Lake freighter|laker]] built to the [[seawaymax|maximum St. Lawrence Seaway size]],<ref name=""Thompson 1994 p. 165"">[[#refThompson1994|Thompson (1994)]], p. 165.</ref>  which was {{convert|730|ft|m|1}} long, {{convert|75|ft|m|1}} wide, and {{convert|25|ft|m|1}} deep.<ref>[[#refJenish2009|Jenish (2009)]], p. 31.</ref> The [[Hull (watercraft)#Metrics|moulded]] depth (roughly speaking, the vertical height of the body of the ship) was {{convert|39|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=""Devendorf p. 151"">[[#refDevendorf1996|Devendorf (1996)]], p. 151</ref>  The hold depth (the inside height of the cargo hold) was {{convert|33|ft|4|in|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name=""Devendorf p. 151""/><ref name=""Thompson 1994, p. 164""/>  GLEW laid the first [[keel]] plate on August 7 the same year.<ref name=""macinnis21"">[[#refMacInnis|MacInnis (1998)]], p. 21.</ref>

With a [[deadweight tonnage|deadweight capacity]] of {{convert|26000|LT|ST t|0|lk=on}},<ref name=""Thompson 1994, p. 164""/> and a {{convert|729|ft}} hull, the ''Fitzgerald'' was the longest ship on the Great Lakes, earning her the title [[Queen of the Lakes]]<ref name=""Thompson 1994 p. 165""/> until September 17, 1959, when the {{convert|730|ft|adj=on}} SS ''Murray Bay'' was launched.<ref>[[#refThompson1994|Thompson (1994)]], p. 170.</ref> The ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s three central cargo holds<ref name=""Wolff, p. 226"">[[#refWolff1979|Wolff (1979)]], p. 226.</ref> were loaded through 21 watertight hatches, each {{convert|11|by|48|ft}} of {{convert|5/16|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick}} steel.<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p9. 15&ndash;16.</ref> Originally coal-fired, the boat's boilers were converted to burn [[Residual fuel|oil]] during the 1971&ndash;72 winter layup.<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], pp. 14, 20.</ref>  In 1969, the ship's maneuverability was improved by the installation of a diesel-powered [[bow thruster]].<ref>[[#refSchumacher2005|Schumacher (2005)]], p. 19.</ref>

By ore freighter standards the interior of the ''Fitzgerald'' was luxurious. Her S.L. Hudson Company-designed furnishings included deep pile carpeting, tiled bathrooms, drapes over the [[porthole]]s, and leather swivel chairs in the guest lounge. There were two guest state rooms for passengers.<ref name=""Schumacher, pp. 62-63"">[[#refSchumacher2005|Schumacher (2005)]], pp. 16–17.</ref>  Air conditioning extended to the crew quarters, which featured more amenities than usual. A large [[galley (kitchen)|galley]] and fully stocked pantry supplied meals for two dining rooms. The ''Fitzgerald'' [[pilothouse]] was outfitted with ""state-of-the-art nautical equipment and a beautiful map room.""<ref name=""Schumacher, pp. 62-63""/>

Northwestern named the boat after President and Chairman of the Board, Edmund Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald's grandfather had been a lake captain and his father owned the Milwaukee Drydock Company that built and repaired ships.<ref>[[#refZielinski2005|Zielinski (2005)]], p. 112.</ref> More than 15,000 people attended the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s [[Ship naming and launching|christening and launch]] ceremony on June 7, 1958. The event was plagued by misfortune. When Elizabeth Fitzgerald, wife of Edmund Fitzgerald, tried to christen the boat by smashing a champagne bottle over the bow, it took her three attempts to break it. A delay of 36 minutes followed while the shipyard crew struggled to release the keel blocks. Upon sideways launch, the boat crashed violently into a pier.<ref>[[#refSchumacher2005|Schumacher (2005)]], p. 15.</ref> On September 22, 1958, ''Fitzgerald'' completed nine days of [[sea trial]]s.<ref>[[#refAndra-Warner2006|Andra-Warner (2006)]], p. 21.</ref>

===Career===

Northwestern's normal practice was to purchase ships for operation by other companies.<ref>[[#refTelescopeStaff1961|Telescope (1961)]], p. 112.</ref> In the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s case they signed a 25-year contract with Oglebay Norton Corporation to operate the vessel.<ref name=""Wolff, p. 226""/> Oglebay Norton immediately designated the ''Fitzgerald'' [[flagship]] of its Columbia Transportation fleet.<ref>[[#refSchumacher2005|Schumacher (2005)]], p. 16.</ref>

The ''Fitzgerald'' was a record-setting ""workhorse"", often beating her own milestones.<ref name=""Thompson 1994, p. 164"">[[#refThompson1994|Thompson (1994)]], p. 164.</ref>  The vessel's record load for a single trip was {{convert|27402|LT|ST t|0}} in 1969.<ref name=""Thompson 1994, p. 164""/> For 17 years the ''Fitzgerald'' carried [[taconite]] from [[Iron Range|Minnesota's Iron Range]] mines near Duluth, Minnesota, to iron works in Detroit, Toledo, and other ports. She set seasonal haul records six different times.<ref name=""Kantar, p. 9""/> Her nicknames included ""Fitz"", ""Pride of the American Flag"",<ref>[[#refKantar2006|Kantar (1998)]], p. 6.</ref> ""Mighty Fitz"", ""Toledo Express"",<ref name=""Schumacher, pp. 9–10"">[[#refSchumacher2005|Schumacher (2005)]], pp. 9–10.</ref> ""Big Fitz"",<ref>[[#refEdwards2000|Edwards (2000)]], p. 5.</ref> and the ""''Titanic'' of the Great Lakes"".<ref name=""Kantar 1998 p. 43"">[[#refKantar2006|Kantar (1998)]], p. 43.</ref> Loading the ''Fitzgerald'' with taconite pellets took about four and a half hours while unloading took around 14&nbsp;hours. A round trip between [[Superior, Wisconsin]], and Detroit, Michigan, usually took her five days and she averaged 47&nbsp;similar trips per season.<ref name=""Stonehouse, p. 28"">[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 28.</ref>  The vessel's usual route was between Superior, Wisconsin, and Toledo, Ohio, although her port of destination could vary.<ref name=""Schumacher, pp. 9–10""/> By November 1975, the ''Fitzgerald'' had logged an estimated 748&nbsp;round trips on the Great Lakes and covered more than a million miles, ""a distance roughly equivalent to 44&nbsp;trips around the world.""<ref>[[#refMacInnis|MacInnis (1998)]], p. 30.</ref>

Up until a few weeks before her loss, passengers had traveled on board as company guests. Frederick Stonehouse wrote: {{Quotation|Stewards treated the guests to the entire VIP routine. The cuisine was reportedly excellent and snacks were always available in the lounge. A small but well stocked kitchenette provided the drinks. Once each trip the captain held a candlelight dinner for the guests, complete with mess-jacketed stewards and special 'clamdigger' punch.<ref name=""Stonehouse, pp. 13–14."">[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], pp. 13–14.</ref>}}

Because of her size, appearance, string of records, and ""dee jay captain"",<ref name=""Thompson 1994, p. 164""/> the ''Fitzgerald'' became a favorite of boat watchers throughout her career. Although Captain Peter Pulcer was in command of the ''Fitzgerald'' on trips when cargo records were set, ""he is best remembered ... for piping music day or night over the ship's intercom system"" while passing through the [[St. Clair River|St. Clair]] and [[Detroit River]]s.<ref name=""Thompson 1994, p. 164""/>  While navigating the [[Soo Locks]] he would often come out of the pilothouse and use a bullhorn to entertain tourists with a commentary on details about the ''Fitzgerald''.<ref name=""Thompson 1994, p. 164""/>

In 1969, the ''Fitzgerald'' received a safety award for eight years of operation without a time-off worker injury.<ref name=""Thompson 1994, p. 164""/>  The vessel ran aground in 1969 and collided with the SS ''Hochelaga'' in 1970. Later that same year she struck the wall of a [[Lock (water transport)|lock]], an accident repeated in 1973 and 1974. During 1974 she lost her original bow anchor in the Detroit River.<ref name=""Bishop, p. 85"">[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 85.</ref> None of these mishaps were considered serious or unusual.<ref>[[#refSchumacher2005|Schumacher (2005)]], p. 18.</ref> Freshwater ships were built to last more than half a century, and the ''Fitzgerald'' should still have had a long career ahead of her when she sank.<ref name=""Schumacher, p. 14""/>

===Final voyage and wreck===
[[Image:Edmund Fitzgerald Trackline.jpg|thumb|left|280px|alt=Map of ''Fitzgerald's'' probable course on final voyage |National Transportation Safety Board map of probable course of ''Edmund Fitzgerald'' and ''Arthur M. Anderson'' (Click to enlarge)]]
The ''Fitzgerald'' left Superior, Wisconsin, at 2:15&nbsp;p.m. on the afternoon of November&nbsp;9, 1975,<ref name=""Wolff, p. 218"">[[#refWolff1979|Wolff (1979)]], p. 218.</ref> under the command of Captain [[Ernest M. McSorley]]. She was en route to the steel mill on [[Zug Island]], near Detroit, Michigan,<ref name=""Lawrence 2008"">[[#refLawrence2008|Lawrence (2008)]].</ref> with a cargo of {{convert|26116|LT|ST t}} of taconite ore pellets and soon reached her full speed of {{convert|16.3|mph|kn km/h}}.<ref name=""NTSB Report, p. 4"">[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB (1978)]], p. 4.</ref> Around 5:00&nbsp;p.m., the ''Fitzgerald'' joined a second freighter under the command of Captain Jesse B. ""Bernie"" Cooper, the ''[[SS Arthur M. Anderson|Arthur M. Anderson]]'', destined for [[Gary, Indiana]], out of [[Two Harbors, Minnesota]].<ref name=""USCG report, p. 22"">[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG (1977)]], p. 22.</ref> The weather forecast was not unusual for November and the [[National Weather Service]] (NWS) predicted that a storm would pass just south of Lake Superior by 7:00&nbsp;a.m. on November&nbsp;10.<ref name=""NTSB Report, p. 10"">[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB (1978)]], p. 10.</ref>

The SS ''Wilfred Sykes'' loaded opposite the ''Fitzgerald'' at the Burlington Northern Dock&nbsp;#1 and departed at 4:15&nbsp;p.m., about two hours after the ''Fitzgerald''. In contrast to the NWS forecast, Captain Dudley J. Paquette of the ''Sykes'' predicted that a major storm would directly cross Lake Superior. From the outset, he chose a route that took advantage of the protection offered by the lake's north shore in order to avoid the worst effects of the storm. The crew of the ''Sykes'' followed the radio conversations between the ''Fitzgerald'' and the ''Anderson'' during the first part of their trip and overheard their captains deciding to take the regular Lake Carriers' Association [[downbound]] route.<ref name=""Bishop 2000 p. 14"">[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 14.</ref> The NWS altered its forecast at 7:00&nbsp;p.m., issuing [[gale warning]]s for the whole of Lake Superior.<ref>[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG (1977)]], p. 18.</ref> The ''Anderson'' and the ''Fitzgerald'' altered course northward seeking shelter along the Canadian coast<ref name=""USCG report, p. 22""/> where they encountered a massive winter storm at 1:00&nbsp;a.m. on November&nbsp;10. The ''Fitzgerald'' reported winds of {{convert|52|kn}} and waves {{convert|10|ft|m|1}} high.<ref name=""USCG report, p. 20"">[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG (1977)]], p. 20.</ref> Captain Paquette of the ''Sykes'' reported that after 1:00&nbsp;a.m., he overheard McSorley say that he had reduced the ship's speed due to the rough conditions. Paquette said he was stunned to later hear McSorley, who was not known for turning aside or slowing down, state, ""we're going to try for some [[Windward and leeward|lee]] from [[Isle Royale]]. You're walking away from us anyway ... I can't stay with you.""<ref name=""Bishop 2000 p. 14""/>

At 2:00&nbsp;a.m. on November&nbsp;10, the NWS upgraded their warnings from gale to storm, forecasting winds of {{convert|35|-|50|kn}}.<ref>[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG (1977)]], p. 19.</ref> Until then, the ''Fitzgerald'' had followed the ''Anderson'', which was travelling at a constant {{convert|14.6|mph|kn km/h}},<ref name=""USCG report, p. 22""/> but the faster ''Fitzgerald'' pulled ahead at about 3:00&nbsp;a.m.<ref name=""NTSB report, p. 5"">[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB (1978)]], p. 5.</ref> As the storm center passed over the ships, they experienced shifting winds, with wind speeds temporarily dropping as wind direction changed from northeast to south and then northwest.<ref name=""USCG report, p. 20""/>  After 1:50&nbsp;p.m., when the ''Anderson'' logged winds of {{convert|5|kn}}, wind speeds again picked up rapidly and it began to snow at 2:45&nbsp;p.m., reducing visibility.<ref name=""USCG report, p. 24"">[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG (1977)]], p. 24.</ref> The ''Anderson'' lost sight of the ''Fitzgerald'', which was about {{convert|16|mi}} ahead at the time.<ref name=""USCG report, p. 25"">[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG (1977)]], p. 25.</ref>

Shortly after 3:30&nbsp;p.m., Captain McSorley radioed the ''Anderson'' to report that the ''Fitzgerald'' was taking on water and had lost two vent covers and a fence railing. The vessel had also developed a [[List (watercraft)|list]].<ref name=""USCG report, p. 26"">[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG (1977)]], p. 26.</ref> Two of the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s six [[bilge pump]]s ran continuously to discharge shipped water.<ref name=""Bishop 2000 p. 6"">[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 6.</ref> McSorley said that he would slow his ship down so that the ''Anderson'' could close the gap between them.<ref name=""USCG report, p. 26""/> In a broadcast shortly afterward, the [[United States Coast Guard]] (USCG) warned all shipping that the Soo Locks had been closed and they should seek safe anchorage. Shortly after 4:10&nbsp;p.m., McSorley called the ''Anderson'' again to report a radar failure and asked the ''Anderson'' to keep track of them.<ref name=""USCG casualty report 1977 p. 27"">[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG (1977)]], p. 27.</ref> The ''Fitzgerald'', effectively blind, slowed to let the ''Anderson'' come within a {{convert|10|mi|adj=on}} range so she could receive radar guidance from the other ship.<ref>[[#refWolff1979|Wolff (1979)]], p. 219.</ref>

For a time the ''Anderson'' directed the ''Fitzgerald'' toward the relative safety of [[Whitefish Bay]]; then at 4:39&nbsp;p.m., McSorley contacted the USCG station in [[Grand Marais, Michigan]], to inquire if the [[Whitefish Point Light|Whitefish Point light]] and navigation [[Electric beacon|beacon]] were operational. The USCG replied that their monitoring equipment indicated that both instruments were inactive.<ref>[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG (1977)]], p. 84.</ref> McSorley then hailed any ships in the Whitefish Point area to report the state of the navigational aids, receiving an answer from Captain Cedric Woodard of the ''Avafors'' between 5:00 and 5:30&nbsp;p.m. that the Whitefish point light was on but not the radio beacon.<ref name=""NTSB report, p. 5""/> Woodward testified to the Marine Board that he overheard McSorley say, ""Don't allow nobody on deck"",<ref name=""NTSB Report, p. 6"">[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB (1978)]], p. 6.</ref> as well as something about a vent that Woodward could not understand.<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 106.</ref> Some time later, McSorley told Woodward that ""I have a 'bad list', I have lost both radars, and am taking heavy seas over the deck in one of the worst seas I have ever been in"".<ref name=""NTSB Report, p. 18"">[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB (1978)]], p. 18.</ref>

By late in the afternoon of November&nbsp;10, sustained winds of over {{convert|50|kn}} were recorded by ships and observation points across eastern Lake Superior.<ref name=""NTSB report, p. 11"">[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB (1978)]], p. 11.</ref> The ''Anderson'' logged sustained winds as high as {{convert|58|kn}} at 4:52&nbsp;p.m.,<ref name=""USCG casualty report 1977 p. 27""/> while waves increased to as high as {{convert|25|ft}} by 6:00&nbsp;p.m.<ref>[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG (1977)]], p. 28.</ref> The ''Anderson'' was also struck by {{convert|70|to|75|kn|adj=on}} gusts<ref name=""NTSB report, p. 11""/> and [[Rogue wave (oceanography)|rogue waves]] as high as {{convert|35|ft}}.<ref name=""Wolff, p. 226""/>

The last communication from the doomed ship came at approximately 7:10&nbsp;p.m., when the ''Anderson'' notified the ''Fitzgerald'' of an [[upbound]] ship and asked how she was doing. McSorley reported, ""We are holding our own."" She sank minutes later. No distress signal was received and ten minutes later the ''Anderson'' could neither raise the ''Fitzgerald'' by radio, nor detect her on radar.<ref name=""NTSB Report, p. 6""/>

Captain Cooper of the ''Anderson'' first called the USCG in Sault Ste. Marie at 7:39&nbsp;p.m. on channel&nbsp;16, the radio distress frequency. The USCG responders instructed him to call back on channel&nbsp;12 because they wanted to keep their emergency channel open and they were having difficulty with their communication systems, including antennas blown down by the storm.<ref name=""Schumacher, p. 79"">[[#refSchumacher2005|Schumacher (2005)]], p. 79.</ref> Cooper then contacted the upbound saltwater vessel ''Nanfri'' and was told that she could not pick up the ''Fitzgerald'' on her radar. Despite repeated attempts to raise the USCG, Cooper was not successful until 7:54&nbsp;p.m. when the officer on duty asked him to keep watch for a {{convert|16|ft|m|adj=on}} outboard lost in the area.<ref name=""Hemming, p. 193"">[[#refHemming1981|Hemming (1981)]], p. 193.</ref> At about 8:25&nbsp;p.m., Cooper again called the USCG to express his concern about the ''Fitzgerald''.<ref>[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG (1977)]], p. 30.</ref>  and at 9:03&nbsp;p.m. reported her missing.<ref>[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG (1977)]], p. 34.</ref> Petty Officer Philip Branch later testified, ""I considered it serious, but at the time it was not urgent.""<ref name=""Schumacher, p. 83"">[[#refSchumacher2005|Schumacher (2005)]], p. 83.</ref>

Lacking appropriate search-and-rescue vessels to respond to the ''Fitzgerald'' disaster,<ref name=""Schumacher, p. 83""/> at approximately 9:00&nbsp;p.m., the USCG asked the ''Anderson'' to turn around and look for survivors. Around 10:30&nbsp;p.m., the USCG asked all commercial vessels anchored in or near Whitefish Bay to assist in the search.<ref name=""Casualty report, p. 36"">[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG (1977)]], p. 36.</ref>  The initial search for survivors was carried out by the ''Anderson'', and a second freighter, the [[SS William Clay Ford|SS ''William Clay Ford'']]. The efforts of a third freighter, the Canadian vessel ''[[Hilda Marjanne]]'', were foiled by the weather. The USCG sent a [[buoy tender]] from Duluth, Minnesota, [[USCGC Woodrush (WLB-407)|''Woodrush'']], but it took two and a half hours to launch and a day to arrive at the search area. The [[Traverse City, Michigan]], USCG station launched a [[Grumman HU-16 Albatross|HU-16]] fixed-wing search aircraft that arrived on the scene at 10:53&nbsp;p.m. while a [[Sikorsky S-62|HH-52]] USCG helicopter with a 3.8-million-[[candlepower]] searchlight arrived at 1:00&nbsp;a.m. on November&nbsp;11.<ref name=""Hemming, p. 195"">[[#refHemming1981|Hemming (1981)]], p. 195.</ref> [[Canadian Coast Guard]] aircraft joined the three-day search and ""the [[Ontario Provincial Police]] established and maintained a beach patrol all along the eastern shore of Lake Superior.""<ref name=""Wolff, p. 221"">[[#refWolff1979|Wolff (1979)]], p. 221.</ref>

Although the search recovered debris, including lifeboats and rafts, no survivors were found.<ref name=""Schumacher, p. 97"">[[#refSchumacher2005|Schumacher (2005)]], p. 97.</ref> On her final voyage the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s crew of 29 consisted of the [[Captain (nautical)|captain]], the [[First mate|first]], [[Second mate|second]] and [[third mate]]s, five [[Seafarer's professions and ranks|engineers]], three [[Oiler (occupation)|oilers]], a cook, a [[Wiper (occupation)|wiper]], two maintenance men, three watchmen, three [[deckhand]]s, three [[wheelsmen]], two porters, a cadet and a [[Chief steward|steward]]. Most of the crew was from Ohio and Wisconsin;<ref>[[#refNolan2000|Nolan (2000)]]</ref> their ages ranged from 21-year-old deckhand Mark Andrew Thomas to Captain McSorley, 63&nbsp;years old and planning his retirement.<ref>[[#refSchumacher2005|Schumacher (2005)]], p. 190.</ref>

The ''Fitzgerald'' is amongst the largest and best-known vessels lost on the Great Lakes<ref>[[#refSwayze1992|Swayze (1992)]], p. 87.</ref> but she is not alone on the Lake Superior seabed in that area. In the years between 1816, when the ''Invincible'' was lost, to the sinking of the ''Fitzgerald'' in 1975, the [[Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve|Whitefish Point]] area had claimed at least 240&nbsp;ships.<ref>[[#refThompson2000|Thompson (2000)]], p. 18.</ref>

===Legal settlement===
Under maritime law ships fall under the jurisdiction of the [[Admiralty law|admiralty courts]] of their flag country. As ''Fitzgerald'' was sailing under the U.S. flag, even though she sank in foreign waters, she was subject to U.S. admiralty law.<ref>[[#refBeisenherz2010|Beizenherz (2010)]]</ref> With a value of $24&nbsp;million, the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s financial loss was the greatest in Great Lakes sailing history.<ref>[[#refWolff1979|Wolff (1979)]], p. 217-218.</ref> In addition to the crew, {{convert|26116|LT|ST t}} of taconite sank along with the vessel.<ref name=""Wolff, p. 218""/> Two widows of crewmen filed a $1.5&nbsp;million lawsuit against ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s owners Northwestern Mutual and operators Oglebay Norton Corporation one week after she sank. An additional $2.1&nbsp;million lawsuit was later filed. Oglebay Norton subsequently filed a petition in the U.S. District Court seeking to ""limit their liability to $817,920 in connection with other suits filed by families of crew members.""<ref name=""Ratigan, p. 345-346"">[[#refRatigan1977|Ratigan (1977)]], pp. 345–346.</ref>  The company paid compensation to surviving families about 12&nbsp;months in advance of official findings of the probable cause and on condition of imposed confidentiality agreements.<ref name=""Ramsey 2009 pp. 16, 26"">[[#refRamsey2009|Ramsey (2009)]], pp. 16, 26, 144&ndash;145.</ref>  Robert Hemming, a reporter and newspaper editor, reasoned in his book about the ''Fitzgerald'' that the USCG's conclusions ""were benign in placing blame on [n]either the company or the captain ...

==Wreck discovery and surveys==
===1975 discovery===

A U.S. Navy aircraft equipped to detect [[magnetic anomalies]] usually associated with submarines found the wreck on November&nbsp;14, 1975. The ''Fitzgerald'' lay about {{convert|17|mi|nmi km}} from the entrance of Whitefish Bay, in Canadian waters close to the international boundary at a depth of {{convert|530|ft|m}}.<ref name=""NTSB Report, p. 6""/> A further November 14–16 survey by the USCG using a [[side scan sonar]] revealed two large objects lying close together on the lake floor. The U.S. Navy also contracted Seaward, Inc., to conduct a second survey between November 22–25.<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 58.</ref>

===Underwater surveys===

From May 20 to 28, 1976, the U.S. Navy dived the wreck using its unmanned [[submersible]], [[CURV-III]], and found the ''Fitzgerald'' lying in two large pieces in {{convert|530|ft}} of water. Navy estimates put the length of the bow section at {{convert|276|ft}} and that of the stern section at {{convert|253|ft}}. The bow section stood upright in the mud, some {{convert|170|ft}} from the stern section that lay face down at a 50-degree angle from the bow. The ship's mid-section had been reduced to heaps of metal and taconite.<ref>[[#refHemming1981|Hemming (1981)]], pp. 211–213.</ref>

In 1980, during a Lake Superior research dive expedition, marine explorer [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]], son of [[Jacques Cousteau]], sent two divers from the [[RV Calypso|RV ''Calypso'']] in the first manned submersible dive to the ''Fitzgerald''.<ref>[[#refHudson2005|Hudson (2005)]], p. 3.</ref> The dive was brief, and although the dive team drew no final conclusions, they speculated that the ''Fitzgerald'' had broken up on the surface.<ref name=""Nuytten, p. 37"">[[#refNuytten2005|Nuytten (2005)]], p. 37.</ref> 

The [[National Sea Grant Program|Michigan Sea Grant Program]] organized a three-day dive using a [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]] (ROV) to survey the ''Fitzgerald'' in 1989. Participants included the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), the [[National Geographic Society]], the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]], the [[Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum|Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society]] (GLSHS), and the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]], the latter providing the RV ''Grayling'' as the support vessel for the ROV.<ref name=""Nuytten, p. 39"">[[#refNuytten2005|Nuytten (2005)]], p. 39.</ref>  The GLSHS used part of the five hours of video footage produced during the dives in a documentary and the National Geographic Society used a segment in a broadcast. Frederick Stonehouse, who wrote one of the first books on the ''Fitzgerald'' wreck, moderated a 1990 panel review of the video that drew no conclusions about the cause of the ''Fitzgerald''{{'s}} sinking.<ref name=""Stonehouse, p. 217"" >[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 217.</ref>

Canadian explorer Joseph MacInnis organized and led six publicly funded dives to the ''Fitzgerald'' over a three-day period in 1994.<ref name=""Stonehouse 2006 p. 209"">[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 209.</ref>  [[Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution]] provided the ''Edwin A.

Shannon's group discovered the remains of a crew member wearing a life jacket lying alongside the bow of the ship, indicating that at least one of the crew was aware of the possibility of sinking.<ref>[[#refThompson2000|Thompson (2000)]], p. 326.</ref> The life jacket had deteriorated canvas and ""what is thought to be six rectangular cork blocks ... clearly visible.""<ref name=""Stonehouse, p. 222"">[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 222.</ref>  Shannon concluded that ""massive and advancing structural failure"" caused the ''Fitzgerald'' to break apart on the surface and sink.<ref name=""Lawrence 2008""/>

MacInnis led another series of dives in 1995 to salvage the bell from the ''Fitzgerald''.<ref name=""Stonehouse, p. 224"">[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 224.</ref> Canadian engineer Phil Nuytten's [[atmospheric diving suit]], known as the ""Newt Suit"", was used to retrieve the bell from the ship, replace it with a replica, and put a beer can in the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s pilothouse.<ref>[[#refFarnquist1996|Farnquist (1996)]], pp. 40, 47.</ref> That same year, Terrence Tysall and Mike Zee set multiple records when they used [[Trimix (breathing gas)|trimix gas]] to scuba dive to the ''Fitzgerald''. The pair are the only people known to have touched the ''Fitzgerald'' wreck. They also set records for the deepest scuba dive on the Great Lakes and the deepest shipwreck dive, and were the first divers to reach the ''Fitzgerald'' without the aid of a submersible. It took six minutes to reach the wreck, six minutes to survey it, and three hours to resurface to avoid [[decompression sickness]], also known as ""the bends"".<ref>[[#refFallstrom1995|Fallstrom (1995)]].</ref>

===Restrictions on surveys===

Under the [[Ontario Heritage Act]], activities on registered archeological sites require a license.<ref>[[#refOntarioHeritageActR.S.O.1990–2009|Ontario Heritage Act (R.S.O. 1990–2009)]].</ref><ref>[[#refGovernmentEfficiencyActS.O.2002,c.18,Sched.F,s.2(27)|Government Efficiency Act S.O. 2002, c.18, Sched.F, s.2 (27)]].</ref> In March 2005, the Whitefish Point Preservation Society accused the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS) of conducting an unauthorized dive to the ''Fitzgerald''.<ref name=""Bellerose2005"">[[#refBellerose2005|Bellerose (2005)]], pp. A1–A2.</ref> Although he admitted to conducting a sonar scan of the wreck in 2002, the director of the GLHS denied such a survey required a license at the time it was carried out.<ref name=""Bellerose2005""/>

An April 2005 amendment to the Ontario Heritage Act allowed the Ontario government to impose a license requirement on dives, the operation of submersibles, side scan sonars or underwater cameras within a designated radius around protected sites.<ref>[[#refOntarioHeritageAmendmentAct,S.O.2005,c.6,s.35|Ontario Heritage Amendment Act, S.O. 2005, c.6, s.35]].</ref><ref>[[#refPollack2005|Pollack (2005)]], p.

==Theories on the cause of sinking==

[[Image:Edmond Fitzgerald relative position of wreck.jpg|thumb|right|alt=USCG drawing of wreck site |USCG drawing of the relative positions of the wreck parts]]

Extreme weather and sea conditions play a role in all of the published theories regarding the ''Fitzgerald''{{'s}} sinking but they differ on the other causal factors.<ref>[[#refStormTechnology2007|Hultquist et al. (2007)]], pp. 607&ndash;608.</ref>

===Waves and weather theory===

In 2005 NOAA and the NWS ran a computer simulation, including weather and wave conditions, covering the period from November&nbsp;9, 1975 until the early morning of November&nbsp;11.<ref>[[#refStormTechnology2007|Hultquist et al. (2007)]], p. 611.</ref> Analysis of the simulation showed that two separate areas of high wind appeared over Lake Superior at 4:00&nbsp;p.m. on November&nbsp;10. One had speeds in excess of {{convert|43|kn}} and the other winds in excess of {{convert|40|kn}}.<ref>[[#refStormTechnology2007|Hultquist et al. (2007)]], p. 616.</ref> The southeastern part of the lake, the direction in which the ''Fitzgerald'' was heading, had the highest winds. Average wave heights increased to near {{convert|19|ft}} by 7:00&nbsp;p.m., November&nbsp;10, and winds exceeded {{convert|50|mph|kn km/h|abbr=on}} over most of southeastern Lake Superior.<ref>[[#refStormTechnology2007|Hultquist et al. (2007)]], p. 620.</ref>

The ''Fitzgerald'' sank at the eastern edge of the area of high wind<ref>[[#refStormTechnology2007|Hultquist et al. (2007)]], p. 617.</ref> where the long [[Fetch (geography)|fetch]], or distance that wind blows over water, produced significant waves averaging over {{convert|23|ft}} by 7:00&nbsp;p.m. and over {{convert|25|ft}} at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. The simulation also showed one in 100&nbsp;waves reaching {{convert|36|ft}} and one out of every&nbsp;1,000 reaching of {{convert|46|ft}}. Since the ship was heading east-southeastward, the waves likely caused the ''Fitzgerald'' to roll heavily.<ref name=""Johnson 2010"">[[#refJohnson2010|Johnson (2010)]]</ref>

At the time of the sinking, the ship ''Arthur M. Anderson'' reported northwest winds of {{convert|57|mph|kn km/h|abbr=on}}, which matches the simulation analysis result of {{convert|54|mph|kn km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name=""Johnson 2010""/> The analysis further showed that the maximum sustained winds reached near [[Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale|hurricane force]] of about {{convert|70|mph|kn km/h|abbr=on}} with gusts to {{convert|86|mph|kn km/h}} at the time and location where the ''Fitzgerald'' sank.<ref>[[#refStormTechnology2007|Hultquist et al(2007)]], p. 620.</ref>

===Rogue wave theory===

A group of three [[rogue wave (oceanography)|rogue waves]], often called ""three sisters"",<ref name=""Wolff, pp. 226&ndash;227""/> was reported in the vicinity of the ''Fitzgerald'' at the time she sank.<ref name=""Bishop, p. 85""/><ref name=""Thompson, p. 324"">[[#refThompson2000|Thompson (2000)]], p. 324.</ref> The ""three sisters"" phenomenon is said to occur on Lake Superior as a result of a sequence of three rogue waves forming that are one-third larger than normal waves. When the first wave hits a ship's deck, before its water drains away the second wave strikes. The third incoming wave adds to the two accumulated backwashes suddenly overloading the deck with tons of water.<ref name=""Bishop, p. 85""/>

Captain Cooper of the ''Anderson'' reported that his ship was ""hit by two 30 to 35 foot seas about 6:30&nbsp;p.m., one burying the after cabins and damaging a lifeboat by pushing it right down onto the saddle. The second wave of this size, perhaps 35 foot, came over the bridge deck.""<ref name=""Wolff, pp. 226&ndash;227"">[[#refWolff1979|Wolff (1979)]], pp. 226&ndash;227.</ref> Cooper went on to say that these two waves, possibly followed by a third, continued in the direction of the ''Fitzgerald'' and would have struck about the time she sank.<ref name=""Thompson, p. 324""/> This theory postulates that the ""three sisters"" compounded the twin problems of the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s known list and her slower speed in heavy seas that already allowed water to remain on her deck for longer than usual.<ref name=""Wolff, p. 227"">[[#refWolff1979|Wolff (1979)]], p. 227.</ref>

===Cargo hold flooding theory===

The July&nbsp;26, 1977, the USCG Marine Casualty Report suggested that the accident was caused by ineffective hatch closures.<ref name=""USCG casualty report 1977 p. 2"">[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG (1977)]], p. 2.</ref> The report concluded that these devices failed to prevent waves from inundating the cargo hold. The flooding occurred gradually and probably imperceptibly throughout the final day, finally resulting in a fatal loss of buoyancy and stability. As a result, the boat plummeted to the bottom without warning.<ref name=""Wolff, p. 223""/>  However, video footage of the ''Fitzgerald'' wreck site showed that most of her hatch clamps were in perfect condition. The USCG Marine board concluded that the few damaged clamps were probably the only ones fastened. As a result ineffective hatch closure caused the ''Fitzgerald'' to flood and founder.<ref>[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG (1977)]], p. 94.</ref>

From the beginning of the USCG inquiry, some of the crewmen's families and various labor organizations believed the USCG findings could be tainted because there were serious questions regarding their preparedness as well as licensing and rules changes.<ref>[[#refWolff1979|Wolff (1979)]], p. 222.</ref> Paul Trimble, a retired USCG vice admiral and president of the Lake Carriers Association (LCA), wrote a letter to the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) on September&nbsp;16, 1977, that included the following statements of objection to the USCG findings:{{Quotation|The present hatch covers are an advanced design and are considered by the entire lake shipping industry to be the most significant improvement over the telescoping leaf covers previously used for many years ... The one-piece hatch covers have proven completely satisfactory in all weather conditions without a single vessel loss in almost 40&nbsp;years of use ... and no water accumulation in cargo holds ...<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 12.</ref>}}
It was common practice for ore freighters, even in foul weather, to embark with not all cargo clamps locked in place on the hatch covers. Maritime author Wolff reported that depending on weather conditions, all the clamps were eventually set within one to two days.<ref name=""Wolff, p. 228"">[[#refWolff1979|Wolff (1979)]], p. 228.</ref> Captain Paquette of the ''Wilfred Sykes'' was dismissive of suggestions that unlocked hatch clamps caused the ''Fitzgerald'' to founder. He said that he commonly sailed in fine weather using the minimum number of clamps necessary to secure the hatch covers.<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 83.</ref>

The May&nbsp;4, 1978, NTSB findings differed from the USCG. The NTSB made the following observations based on the CURV-III survey: {{Quotation|The No.&nbsp;1 hatch cover was entirely inside the No.&nbsp;1 hatch and showed indications of buckling from external loading. Sections of the coaming in way of the No.&nbsp;1 hatch were fractured and buckled inward. The No.&nbsp;2 hatch cover was missing and the coaming on the No.&nbsp;2 hatch was fractured and buckled. Hatches Nos.&nbsp;3 and 4 were covered with mud; however, one corner of hatch cover No.&nbsp;3 could be seen in place. Hatch cover No.&nbsp;5 was missing. A series of 16&nbsp;consecutive hatch cover clamps were observed on the No.&nbsp;5 hatch coaming. Of this series, the first and eighth were distorted or broken. All of the 14&nbsp;other clamps were undamaged and in the open position. The No.&nbsp;6 hatch was open and a hatch cover was standing on end vertically in the hatch. The hatch covers were missing from hatches Nos.&nbsp;7 and 8 and both coamings were fractured and severely distorted. The bow section abruptly ended just aft of hatch No.&nbsp;8 and the deck plating was ripped up from the separation to the forward end of hatch No.&nbsp;7.<ref>[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB (1978)]], p. 12.</ref>}}

The NTSB conducted computer studies,<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 181.</ref> testing and analysis to determine the forces necessary to collapse the hatch covers<ref>[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB (1978)]], p. 14.</ref> and concluded that the ''Fitzgerald'' sank suddenly from massive flooding of the cargo hold ""due to the collapse of one or more of the hatch covers under the weight of giant boarding seas"" instead of flooding gradually due to ineffective hatch closures.<ref name=""Wolff, p. 224"">[[#refWolff1979|Wolff (1979)]], p. 224.</ref> The NTSB dissenting opinion held that the ''Fitzgerald'' sank suddenly and unexpectedly from [[shoal]]ing.<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 190.</ref>

===Shoaling theory===

[[Image:Fitz Upbound & In Ballast - Coast Guard.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=SS Edmund Fitzgerald upbound and in ballast |SS ''Edmund Fitzgerald'' [[upbound]] and in [[Sailing ballast|ballast]]]]

The LCA believed that instead of hatch cover leakage, the more probable cause of the ''Fitzgerald'' loss was [[shoal]]ing or grounding in the Six Fathom Shoal northwest of [[Caribou Island (Lake Superior)|Caribou Island]] when the vessel ""unknowingly raked a [[reef]]"" during the time the Whitefish Point light and radio beacon were not available as navigation aids.<ref name=""Wolff, p. 224""/> This theory was supported by a 1976&nbsp;Canadian hydrographic survey, which disclosed that an unknown shoal ran a mile further east of Six Fathom Shoal than shown on the Canadian charts. Officers from the ''Anderson'' observed that the ''Fitzgerald'' sailed through this exact area.<ref name=""Wolff, p. 224""/> Conjecture by proponents of the Six Fathom Shoal theory concluded that the ''Fitzgerald's'' downed fence rail reported by McSorley could occur only if the ship ""hogged"" during shoaling, with the bow and stern bent downward and the midsection raised by the shoal, pulling the railing tight until the cables dislodged or tore under the strain.<ref name=""Bishop 2000 p. 6""/> However, divers searched the Six Fathom Shoal after the wreck occurred and found no evidence of ""a recent collision or grounding anywhere.""<ref name=""Bishop, p. 9"">[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 9.</ref> Maritime authors Bishop and Stonehouse wrote that the shoaling theory was later challenged on the basis of the higher quality of detail in Shannon's 1994&nbsp;photography that ""explicitly show[s] the devastation of the ''Fitzgerald''.""<ref name=""Stonehouse, p. 222""/>  Shannon's photography of the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s overturned stern showed ""no evidence on the bottom of the stern, the propeller or the rudder of the ship that would indicate the ship struck a shoal.""<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], pp. 8&ndash;9.</ref>

Maritime author Stonehouse reasoned that ""unlike the Lake Carriers, the Coast Guard had no vested interest in the outcome of their investigation.""<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 83.</ref> Author Bishop reported that Captain Paquette of the ''Wilfred Sykes'' argued that through their support for the shoaling explanation, the LCA represented the shipping company's interests by advocating a theory that held LCA member companies, the [[American Bureau of Shipping]], and the US Coast Guard Service blameless.<ref name=""Bishop, p. 9""/>

Paul Hainault, a retired professor of mechanical engineering from [[Michigan Technological University]], promoted a theory that began as a student class project. His hypothesis held that the ''Fitzgerald'' grounded at 9:30&nbsp;a.m. on November&nbsp;10 on Superior Shoal. This shoal, discovered in 1930, is an underwater mountain in the middle of Lake Superior about {{convert|50|mi}} north of [[Copper Harbor, Michigan]].<ref name=""Stonehouse, p. 239 "">[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 239.</ref> It has sharp peaks that rise nearly to the lake surface with water depths ranging from {{convert|22|to|400|ft}}, making it a menace to navigation. Discovery of the shoal resulted in a change in recommended shipping routes.<ref>[[#refWoodford1994|Woodford (1994)]], p. 121.</ref> A [[seiche]], or standing wave, that occurred during the low-pressure system over Lake Superior on November&nbsp;10, 1975, caused the lake to rise {{convert|3|ft}} over the Soo Locks' gates to flood Portage Avenue in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, with {{convert|1|ft|1}} of water.<ref>[[#refKnight1975|Knight (1975)]].</ref>  Hainault's theory held that this seiche contributed to the ''Fitzgerald'' shoaling {{convert|200|ft}} of her hull on Superior Shoal, causing the hull to be punctured mid-body. The hypothesis contended that the wave action continued to damage the hull, until the middle third dropped out like a box, leaving the ship held together by the center deck. The stern section acted as an anchor and caused the ''Fitzgerald'' to come to a full stop, causing everything to go forward. The ship broke apart on the surface within seconds. Compressed air pressure blew a hole in the starboard bow, which sank 18&nbsp;degrees off course. The rear kept going forward with the engine still running, rolled to port and landed bottom up.<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], pp. 240–241.</ref>

===Structural failure theory===

Another published theory contends that an already weakened structure, and modification of the ''Fitzgerald''{{'s}} winter [[Ship's load line|load line]] (that allows heavier loading and travel lower in the water), made it possible for large waves to cause a stress fracture in the hull. This is based on the ""regular"" huge waves of the storm and does not necessarily involve rogue waves.<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 84.</ref>

The USCG and NTSB investigated whether the ''Fitzgerald'' broke apart due to structural failure of the hull and because the 1976 CURV&nbsp;III survey found the ''Fitzgerald'' sections were {{convert|170|ft}} from each other, the USCG's formal casualty report of July&nbsp;1977 concluded that she had separated upon hitting the lake floor.<ref name=""Wolff, p. 223"">[[#refWolff1979|Wolff (1979)]], p. 223.</ref> The NTSB came to the same conclusion as USCG because:{{Quotation|The proximity of the bow and stern sections on the bottom of Lake Superior indicated that the vessel sank in one piece and broke apart either when it hit bottom or as it descended. Therefore, the ''Fitzgerald'' did not sustain a massive structural failure of the hull while on the surface ... The final position of the wreckage indicated that if the ''Fitzgerald'' had capsized, it must have suffered a structural failure before hitting the lake bottom. The bow section would have had to right itself and the stern portion would have had to capsize before coming to rest on the bottom. It is, therefore, concluded that the ''Fitzgerald'' did not capsize on the surface.<ref name=""NTSB Report, p. 18""/>}}

However, after maritime historian Frederick Stonehouse moderated the panel reviewing the video footage from the 1989&nbsp;ROV survey of the ''Fitzgerald'', he concluded that the extent of taconite coverage over the wreck site showed that the stern had floated on the surface for a short time and spilled taconite into the forward section; thus the two sections of the wreck did not sink at the same time.<ref name=""Stonehouse, p. 217 ""/> The 1994&nbsp;Shannon team found that the stern and the bow were {{convert|255|ft}} apart leading Shannon to conclude that the ''Fitzgerald'' broke up on the surface.<ref name=""Bishop, p. 86""/>  He said: {{Quotation|This placement does not support the theory that the ship plunged to the bottom in one piece, breaking apart when it struck bottom. If this were true, the two sections would be much closer. In addition, the angle, repose and mounding of clay and mud at the site indicate the stern rolled over on the surface, spilling taconite ore pellets from its severed cargo hold, and then landed on portions of the cargo itself.<ref name=""Bishop, p. 86""/>}}

The stress fracture theory was supported by the testimony of former crewmen. Former Second Mate Richard Orgel, who served on the ''Fitzgerald'' in 1972 and 1973, testified that ""the ship had a tendency to bend and spring during storms 'like a diving board after somebody has jumped off.{{' ""}}<ref name=""Wolff, p. 227""/> Orgel was quoted as saying that the loss of the ''Fitzgerald'' was caused by hull failure, ""pure and simple. I detected undue stress in the side tunnels by examining the white enamel paint, which will crack and splinter when submitted to severe stress.""<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 90.</ref> George H. ""Red"" Burgner, the ''Fitzgerald''{{'s}} [[Chief steward|Steward]] for ten seasons and winter ship-keeper for seven years, testified in a deposition that a ""loose [[keel]]"" contributed to the vessel's loss. Burgner further testified that ""the keel and sister [[kelson]]s were only 'tack welded'"" and that he had personally observed that many of the welds were broken.<ref name=""Wolff, p. 228""/> Burgner was not asked to testify before the Marine Board of Inquiry.<ref name=""Wolff, p. 227""/>

When [[Bethlehem Steel|Bethlehem Steel Corporation]] permanently laid up the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s sister ship, SS ''Arthur B. Homer'', just five years after going to considerable expense to lengthen her, questions were raised as to whether both ships had the same structural problems.<ref name=""Bishop, p. 92"">[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 92.</ref> The two vessels were built in the same shipyard using welded joints in instead of the riveted joints used in older ore freighters. Riveted joints allow a ship to flex and work in heavy seas, while welded joints are more likely to break.<ref name=""Bishop, p. 92""/> Reports indicate that repairs to the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s hull were delayed in 1975 due to plans to lengthen the ship during the upcoming winter layup. The ''Homer'' was lengthened to {{convert|825|ft}} and placed back in service by December&nbsp;1975, not long after the ''Fitzgerald'' foundered. In 1978, without explanation, Bethlehem Steel Corporation denied permission for the chairman of the NTSB to travel on the ''Homer''. The ''Homer'' was permanently laid up in 1980 and broken for scrap in 1987.<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 93.</ref>

Retired GLEW naval architect Raymond Ramsey, one of the design team on the hull of the ''Fitzgerald'',<ref>[[#refRamsey2009|Ramsey (2009)]], p. 48.</ref> reviewed her increased load lines, maintenance history, along with the history of long ship hull failure and concluded that the ''Fitzgerald'' was not seaworthy on November&nbsp;10, 1975.<ref>[[#refRamsey2009|Ramsey (2009)]], p. 16.</ref> He stated that planning the ''Fitzgerald'' to be compatible with the constraints of the St. Lawrence Seaway had placed her hull design in a ""straight jacket"".<ref>[[#refRamsey2009|Ramsey (2009)]], p. 66.</ref> The ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s long ship design was developed without the benefit of [[Research and development|research, development, test, and evaluation]] principles while computerized analytical technology was not available at the time she was built.<ref>[[#refRamsey2009|Ramsey (2009)]], p. 37.</ref> Ramsey noted that the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s hull was built with an all-welded (instead of riveted) modular fabrication method,<ref>[[#refRamsey2009|Ramsey (2009)]], p. 45.</ref> which was used for the first time in the GLEW shipyard.<ref name=""Schumacher, p. 14""/><ref name=""macinnis21""/> Ramsey concluded that increasing the hull length to {{convert|729|ft}} resulted in a L/D slenderness ratio (the ratio of the length of the ship to the depth of her structure)<ref>[[#refCharlesFurnessCrane1997|Charles, Furness, and Crane (1997)]], p. 258.</ref> that caused excessive multi-axial bending and springing of the hull, and that the hull should have been structurally reinforced to cope with her increased length.<ref>[[#refRamsey2009|Ramsey (2009)]], pp. 71, 134.</ref>

===Topside damage theory===

The USCG agreed that topside damage was a reasonable alternative reason for the ''Fitzgerald'' sinking and surmised that damage to the fence rail and vents was possibly caused by a heavy floating object such as a log.<ref>[[#refThompson2000|Thompson (2000)]], p. 325.</ref> Historian and mariner Mark Thompson instead believes the more plausible explanation that something broke loose from the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s deck. He theorized that the loss of the vents resulted in flooding of two ballast tanks or a ballast tank and a walking tunnel that caused the ship to list. Thompson further conjectured that there was more extensive damage than Captain McSorley could detect in the pilothouse thereby allowing water to flood the cargo hold. He concluded that the topside damage the ''Fitzgerald'' experienced at 3:30&nbsp;p.m. on November&nbsp;10, compounded by the heavy seas, was the most obvious explanation for why she sank. Thompson wrote that to ignore the incontrovertible evidence of the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s topside damage was ""analogous to theorizing that ''Titanic'' was sunk by a German U-boat"".<ref>[[#refThompson2000|Thompson (2000)]], p. 328.</ref>

==Possible contributing factors==

The USCG, NTSB, and proponents of alternative theories have all named multiple possible contributing factors to the foundering of the ''Fitzgerald''.

[[File:SS Edmund Fitzgerald scale model.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Scale mode of ''Fitzgerald'' |Scale model of the SS ''Edmund Fitzgerald'']]

===Weather forecasting===

The NWS long range forecast on November&nbsp;9, 1975, predicted that a storm would pass just south of Lake Superior and over the [[Keweenaw Peninsula]]. Captain Paquette of the ''Wilfred Sykes'' had been following and charting the low pressure system over [[Oklahoma]] since November&nbsp;8 and concluded that a major storm would track across eastern Lake Superior. He therefore chose a route that gave the ''Sykes'' the most protection and took refuge in [[Thunder Bay]] during the worst of the storm. Based on the NWS forecast, the ''Arthur M. Anderson'' and ''Edmund Fitzgerald'' instead started their trip across Lake Superior following the regular Lake Carriers Association route, which placed them in the path of the storm.<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. xii.</ref>  The NTSB investigation concluded that the NWS failed to accurately predict wave heights on November&nbsp;10.<ref>[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB (1978)]], p. 21.</ref>  After running computer models in 2005 using actual meteorological data from November&nbsp;10, 1975, Hulquist of the NWS said of the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s position in the storm, ""It ended in precisely the wrong place at the absolute worst time.""<ref>[[#refBohnak2007|Bohnak (2007)]], p. 316.</ref>

===Inaccurate navigational charts===

After reviewing testimony that the ''Fitzgerald'' had passed near shoals north of Caribou Island, the USCG Marine Board examined the relevant navigational charts. They found that the Canadian 1973&nbsp;navigational chart for the Six Fathom Shoal area was based on Canadian surveys from 1916 and 1919 and that the 1973&nbsp;U.S. Lake Survey Chart No.&nbsp;9 included the notation, ""Canadian Areas. For data concerning Canadian areas, Canadian authorities have been consulted.""<ref>[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG (1977)]], pp. 85&ndash;86</ref> Thereafter, at the request of the Marine Board and the Commander of the USCG Ninth District, the [[Canadian Hydrographic Service]] conducted a survey of the area surrounding [[Michipicoten Island]] and Caribou Island in 1976. The survey revealed that the shoal ran about {{convert|1|mi}} further east than shown on Canadian charts.<ref>[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG (1977)]], pp. 86–87</ref> The NTSB investigation concluded that at the time of the ''Fitzgerald'' foundering, Lake Survey Chart No.&nbsp;9 was not detailed enough to indicate Six Fathom Shoal as a hazard to navigation.<ref>[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB (1978)]], pp. 21, 23.</ref>

===Lack of watertight bulkheads===

Mark Thompson, a [[Merchant Navy|merchant seaman]] and author of numerous books on Great Lakes shipping, stated that if her cargo holds had watertight subdivisions, ""the ''Fitzgerald'' could have made it into Whitefish Bay.""<ref>[[#refThomspon1991|Thompson (1991)]], p. 167.</ref>  Frederick Stonehouse also held that the lack of watertight [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s caused the ''Fitzgerald'' to sink. He said: {{Quotation|The Great Lakes ore carrier is the most commercially efficient vessel in the shipping trade today. But it's nothing but a motorized barge!  It's the unsafest commercial vessel afloat. It has virtually no watertight integrity. Theoretically, a one-inch puncture in the cargo hold will sink it.<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], pp. 105&ndash;106.</ref>}}

Stonehouse called on ship designers and builders to design lake carriers more like ships rather than ""motorized super-barges""<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 124.</ref> making the following comparison: {{Quotation|Contrast this [the ''Fitzgerald''] with the story of the SS ''Maumee'', an oceangoing tanker that struck an iceberg near the South Pole recently. The collision tore a hole in the ship's bow large enough to drive a truck through, but the'' Maumee'' was able travel halfway around the world to a repair yard, without difficulty, because she was fitted with watertight bulkheads.<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 117.</ref>}}

After the ''Fitzgerald'' foundered, Great Lakes shipping companies were accused of valuing cargo [[Cargo|payloads]] more than human life,<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], pp. 104–105.</ref> since the vessel's {{ft3 to m3|860950}} cargo hold had been divided by two non-watertight traverse ""screen"" bulkheads. The NTSB ''Fitzgerald'' investigation concluded that Great Lakes freighters should be constructed with watertight bulkheads in their cargo holds.<ref>[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB (1978)]], p. 25.</ref>

The USCG had proposed rules for watertight bulkheads in Great Lakes vessels as far back as the sinking of the [[SS Daniel J. Morrell|''Morrell'']] in 1966 and did so again after the sinking of the ''Fitzgerald'', arguing that this would allow ships to make it to refuge or at least allow crew members to abandon ship in an orderly fashion. The LCA represented the Great Lakes fleet owners and was able to forestall watertight subdivision regulations<ref>[[#ref46 U.S.C.§179.212|46 U.S.C. §179.212]].</ref> by arguing that this would cause economic hardship for vessel operators. A few vessel operators have built Great Lakes ships with watertight subdivisions in the cargo holds since 1975, but most vessels operating on the lakes cannot prevent flooding of the entire cargo hold area.<ref>[[#refThomspon1991|Thompson (1991)]], p. 168.</ref>

===Lack of instrumentation===

[[File:Edmund Fitzgerald-USACE.jpg|thumb |250px |right |alt=SS Edmund Fitzgerald underway |SS ''Edmund Fitzgerald'' underway]]
Since a [[fathometer]] was not required under USCG regulations, the ''Fitzgerald'' did not have one.<ref>[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG (1977)]], p. 9.</ref>  Instead a [[Sounding line|hand line]] was the only method the ''Fitzgerald'' had to take depth soundings although fathometers were available at the time of her sinking. The hand line consisted of a piece of line knotted at measured intervals with a lead weight on the end. The line was thrown over the bow of the ship and the count of the knots measured the water depth.<ref name=""Stonehouse, p. 102."">[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 102.</ref>  The NTSB investigation concluded that a fathometer would have provided the ''Fitzgerald'' additional navigational data and made her less dependent on the ''Anderson'' for navigational assistance.<ref name=""NTSB Accident Report 1978 p. 23"">[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB (1978)]], p. 23.</ref>

The ''Fitzgerald'' had no system to monitor the presence or amount of water in her cargo hold even though there was always some present. The intensity of the November&nbsp;10 storm would have made it difficult, if not impossible, to access the hatches from the spar deck. The USCG Marine Board found that flooding of the hold could not have been assessed until the water reached the top of the taconite cargo.<ref>[[#refSchumacher2005|Schumacher (2005)]], p. 134.</ref> The NTSB investigation concluded that it would have been impossible to pump water from the hold when it was filled with bulk cargo.<ref>[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB (1978)]], pp. 17, 23.</ref>  The Marine Board noted that because the ''Fitzgerald'' lacked a draft-reading system, the crew had no way to determine whether the vessel had lost [[Freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] (the level of a ship's deck above the water).<ref>[[#refSchumacher2005|Schumacher (2005)]], p. 135.</ref>

===Increased load lines, reduced freeboard===

The USCG increased the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s load line in 1969, 1971, and 1973 to allow {{convert|3|ft|3.25|in|mm|0}} less minimum freeboard than the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s original design allowed in 1958.<ref name=""Wolff, p. 223""/> This meant that ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s deck was only {{Convert|11.5|ft}} above the water when she faced {{convert|35|ft}} waves during the November&nbsp;10 storm.<ref name=""NTSB report, p. 8"">[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB (1978)]], p. 8.</ref>  Captain Paquette of the ''Sykes'' noted that this change allowed loading to 4,000 tons above what the ''Fitz'' was designed to carry.<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 137.</ref>

Concerns regarding the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s keel welding problem surfaced during the time the USCG started increasing her load line.<ref name=""Wolff, p. 228""/> This increase and the resultant reduction in freeboard decreased the vessel's critical reserve buoyancy. Prior to the load line increases she was said to be a ""good riding ship"" but afterwards the ''Fitzgerald'' became a sluggish ship with slower response and recovery times. Captain McSorley said he did not like the action of a ship he described as a ""wiggling thing"" that scared him. The ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s bow hooked to one side or the other in heavy seas without recovering and made a groaning sound not heard on other ships.<ref name=""Wolff, p. 228""/>

===Maintenance===

NTSB investigators noted that the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s prior [[Ship grounding|groundings]] could have caused undetected damage that led to major structural failure during the storm, since Great Lakes vessels were normally [[drydock]]ed for inspection only once every five years.<ref name=""NTSB Accident Report 1978 p. 23""/> It was also alleged that when compared to the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s previous captain, McSorley did not keep up with routine maintenance and did not confront the mates about getting the requisite work done.<ref name=""Wolff, p. 228""/> After August B. Herbel, Jr., president of the [[ASTM International|American Society for Testing Metals]], examined photographs of the welds on the ''Fitzgerald'', he stated, ""the hull was just being held together with patching plates.""  Other questions were raised as to why the USCG did not discover and take corrective action in its pre-November&nbsp;1975 inspection of the ''Fitzgerald'' given that her hatch coamings, gaskets, and clamps were poorly maintained.<ref name=""Thompson 2000 p. 349"">[[#refThompson2000|Thompson (2000)]], p. 349.</ref>

===Complacency===

On November&nbsp;10, 1975, McSorley reported he had never seen bigger seas in his life.<ref name=""Wolff, p. 221""/> Paquette, master of ''Wilfred Sykes'' out in the same storm said, ""I'll tell anyone that it was a ''monster'' sea washing solid water over the deck of every vessel out there.""<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 108.</ref> The USCG did not broadcast that all ships should seek safe anchorage until after 3:35&nbsp;p.m. on November&nbsp;10, many hours after the weather was upgraded from a gale to a storm.<ref name=""USCG casualty report 1977 p. 27""/>

McSorley was known as a ""heavy weather captain""<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], pp. 22, 76.</ref> who {{"" '}}beat hell' out of the ''Fitzgerald'' and 'very seldom ever hauled up for weather{{' ""}}.<ref name=""Wolff, p. 228""/> Paquette held the opinion that negligence caused the ''Fitzgerald'' to founder. He said, ""in my opinion, all the subsequent events arose because (McSorley) kept pushing that ship and didn't have enough training in weather forecasting to use common sense and pick a route out of the worst of the wind and seas.""<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 76.</ref>  Paquette's vessel was the first to reach a discharge port after the November&nbsp;10 storm; she was met by company attorneys who came aboard the ''Sykes''. He told them that the ''Fitzgerald'' foundering was caused by negligence.<ref name=""Bishop, p. 30"">[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 30.</ref> Paquette was never asked to testify during the USCG or NTSB investigations.<ref name=""Bishop, p. 30""/>

The NTSB investigation noted that Great Lakes cargo vessels could normally avoid severe storms and called for the establishment of a limiting sea state applicable to Great Lakes bulk cargo vessels. This would restrict the operation of vessels in sea states above the limiting value.<ref>[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB (1978)]], pp. 24–25.</ref> One concern was that shipping companies pressured the captains to deliver cargo as quickly and cheaply as possible regardless of bad weather.<ref>[[#refThompson2000|Thompson (2000)]], p. 333.</ref> At the time of the ''Fitzgerald'' foundering, there was no evidence that any governmental regulatory agency tried to control vessel movement in foul weather despite the historical record that hundreds of Great Lakes vessels had been wrecked in storms. The USCG took the position that only the captain could decide when it was safe to sail.<ref>[[#refThompson2000|Thompson (2000)]], p. 315.</ref>

The USCG Marine Board issued the following conclusion:{{Quotation|The nature of Great Lakes shipping, with short voyages, much of the time in very protected waters, frequently with the same routine from trip to trip, leads to complacency and an overly optimistic attitude concerning the extreme weather conditions that can and do exist. The Marine Board feels that this attitude reflects itself at times in deferral of maintenance and repairs, in failure to prepare properly for heavy weather, and in the conviction that since refuges are near, safety is possible by ""running for it.""  While it is true that sailing conditions are good during the summer season, changes can occur abruptly, with severe storms and extreme weather and sea conditions arising rapidly. This tragic accident points out the need for all persons involved in Great Lakes shipping to foster increased awareness of the hazards which exist.<ref>[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG (1977)]], p. 103.</ref>}}

Mark Thompson countered that ""the Coast Guard laid bare [its] own complacency"" by blaming the sinking of the ''Fitzgerald'' on industry-wide complacency since it inspected the ''Fitzgerald'' just two weeks before she sank.<ref name=""Thompson 2000 p. 349""/>  The loss of the ''Fitzgerald'' also exposed the USCG's lack of rescue capability on Lake Superior.<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 109.</ref>  Thompson said that ongoing budget cuts had limited the USCG's ability to perform its historical functions. He further noted that USCG rescue vessels were unlikely to reach the scene of an incident on Lake Superior or Lake Huron within 6&nbsp;to 12&nbsp;hours of its occurrence.<ref>[[#refThompson2000|Thompson (2000)]], p. 369.</ref>

==Subsequent changes to Great Lakes shipping practice==

The USCG investigation of the ''Fitzgerald'' sinking resulted in 15&nbsp;recommendations regarding load lines, weathertight integrity, search and rescue capability, lifesaving equipment, crew training, loading manuals, and providing information to masters of Great Lakes vessels.<ref>[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG (1977)]], pp. 105&ndash;108.</ref> NTSB's investigation resulted in 19&nbsp;recommendations for the USCG, four recommendations for the American Bureau of Shipping, and two recommendations for NOAA.<ref>[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB (1978)]], pp. 24–27.</ref> Of the official recommendations, the following actions and USCG regulations were put in place:
:1. In 1977, the USCG made it a requirement that all vessels of 1,600&nbsp;[[Gross register tonnage|gross register tons]] and over use depth finders.<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 182.</ref>
:2. Since 1980, [[survival suit]]s have been required aboard ship in each crew member's quarters and at their customary work station with strobe lights affixed to life jackets and survival suits.<ref name=""Thompson, p. 329"">[[#refThompson2000|Thompson (2000)]], p. 329.</ref>
:3. A [[LORAN|LORAN-C]] positioning system for navigation on the Great Lakes was implemented in 1980 and later replaced with [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) in the 1990s.<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 187.</ref>
:4. [[Distress radiobeacon|Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons]] (EPIRB) are installed on all Great Lakes vessels for immediate and accurate location in event of a disaster.<ref name=""Thompson, p. 329""/>
:5. Navigational charts for northeastern Lake Superior were improved for accuracy and greater detail.<ref name=""Wolff, p. 229"">[[#refWolff1979|Wolff (1979)]], p. 229.</ref>
:6. NOAA revised its method for predicting wave heights.<ref name=""Wolff, p. 229""/>
:7. The USCG rescinded the 1973 Load Line Regulation amendment that permitted reduced freeboard loadings.<ref>[[#refRamsey2009|Ramsey (2009)]], p. 78.</ref>
:8. The USCG began the annual pre-November inspection program recommended by the NTSB.  ""Coast Guard inspectors now board all U.S. ships during the fall to inspect hatch and vent closures and lifesaving equipment.""<ref>[[#refThomspon1991|Thompson (1991)]], p. 169.</ref>

Karl Bohnak, a Upper Peninsula meteorologist, covered the sinking and storm in a book on local weather history. In this book, Joe Warren, a deckhand on the ''Anderson'' during the November&nbsp;10, 1975 storm, said that the storm changed the way things were done. He stated, ""After that, trust me, when a gale came up we dropped the hook [anchor]. We dropped the hook because they found out the big ones could sink.""<ref>[[#refBohnak2007|Bohnak (2007)]], p. 318.</ref>  However, Mark Thompson wrote, ""Since the loss of the ''Fitz'', some captains may be more prone to go to anchor, rather than venturing out in a severe storm, but there are still too many who like to portray themselves as 'heavy weather sailors'.""<ref>[[#refThomspon1991|Thompson (1991)]], p. 170.</ref>

Uproar occurred in 1995 when Jeff Stevens, a maintenance worker in [[St. Ignace]], Michigan, refurbished the bell by stripping the protective coating applied by Michigan State University experts.<ref>[[#refPoulson1996|Poulson (1996)]].</ref> The controversy continued when the [[Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum]] tried to use the bell as a touring exhibit in 1996. Relatives of the crew halted this move, objecting that the bell was being used as a ""traveling trophy"".<ref>[[#refSchumacher2005|Schumacher (2005)]], p. 172.</ref> The bell is now on display in the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum in [[Whitefish Bay|Whitefish Point]] near [[Paradise, Michigan|Paradise]], [[Michigan]].<ref>[[#refWalsh-Sarnecki2005|Walsh-Sarnecki (2005)]].</ref>

An anchor from ''Fitzgerald'' lost on an earlier trip was recovered from the Detroit River and is on display at the [[Belle Isle Park#Dossin Great Lakes Museum|Dossin Great Lakes Museum]] in Detroit, Michigan.<ref>[[#refDetroitHistoricalSociety2011|Detroit Historical Society (2011)]].</ref>  Artifacts on display in the [[Steamship Valley Camp]] museum in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan]], include two lifeboats, photos, a movie of the ''Fitzgerald'' and commemorative models and paintings. Every November&nbsp;10 the [[Split Rock Lighthouse]] in [[Silver Bay, Minnesota]] emits a light in honor of the ''Edmund Fitzgerald.''

On August&nbsp;8, 2007, a Michigan family discovered a lone life saving ring on the [[Keweenaw Peninsula]] along a remote shore of Lake Superior that appeared to have come from the ''Fitzgerald.'' It was thought to be a hoax because it bore markings different from those of proven rings found at the wreck site.<ref>[[#refKaroubAug92007|Karoub (August 9, 2007)]].</ref> Later it was confirmed by the owner, who lost it, that the life ring was not from the ''Fitzgerald'', but was made by her father as a personal memorial.<ref>[[#refAssociatedPress2007|Associated Press (2007)]].</ref>

===Musical and theater tributes===

In 1976, Canadian singer-songwriter [[Gordon Lightfoot]] wrote, composed, and recorded the song ""The Wreck of the ''Edmund Fitzgerald''"" for his album ''[[Summertime Dream]]''. Lightfoot's popular ballad made the sinking of the ''Fitzgerald'' one of the most well known disasters in the history of [[Great Lakes]] shipping.<ref name=""Kantar 1998 p. 43""/>  The original lyrics of the song show a degree of artistic license compared to the events of the actual sinking and, in light of new evidence about what happened, Lightfoot has modified one line for live performances.<ref>[[#refStevenson2010|Stevenson (2010)]].</ref><ref>[[#refQuill2010|Quill (2010)]].</ref>  The song has been covered by many performers. The Canadian rock band [[Rheostatics]] recorded it for their second album, ''[[Melville (album)|Melville]]'', and their live album ''[[Double Live (Rheostatics album)|Double Live]]''. [[The Dandy Warhols]] also covered the song in their ''[[The Black Album (The Dandy Warhols album)|The Black Album]]'' in 2004.<ref>[[#refTorontoStarstaff2005|''Toronto Star'' staff (2005)]].</ref>

In 1986, writer [[Steven Dietz]] and songwriter/lyricist Eric Peltoniemi wrote the musical ''Ten November'' in memory of the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s sinking. In 2005, the play was re-edited into a concert version called ''The Gales of November'',<ref>[[#refMinnesotaPublicRadio2005|Minnesota Public Radio (2005)]].</ref> which opened on the 30th anniversary of the sinking at the [[Fitzgerald Theater]] in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]].<ref>[[#refAamot2005|Aamot (2005)]].</ref> A piano concerto entitled ""The ''Edmund Fitzgerald''"" was written by American composer Geoffrey Peterson in 2002; it premiered by the [[Sault Symphony Orchestra]] in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada in November 2005 as another 30th anniversary commemoration.<ref>[[#refSaultSymphonyOrchestra2005|Sault Symphony Orchestra (2005)]].</ref>

===Commercialization===
The fame of the ''Fitzgerald''{{'}}s image and story have made it public domain and subject to commercialization.<ref>[[#refSchumacher2005|Schumacher (2005)]], p. 173.</ref> A ""cottage industry""<ref name=""Stonehouse, p. 205 "">[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 205.</ref> has evolved across the Great Lakes region from Two Harbors, Minnesota, to Whitefish Point, the incident's ""[[ground zero]]"".<ref name=""Donnelly2000"">[[#refDonnelly2000|Donnelly (2000)]].</ref> Memorabilia on sale include Christmas ornaments, T-shirts, coffee mugs, ''Edmund Fitzgerald'' beer, videos, and other items commemorating the vessel and its loss.<ref>[[#refDybas2000|Dybas (2000)]].</ref>

'''''Freedom of Expression®''''' is a book about [[freedom of speech]] issues with respect to concepts of [[intellectual property]], written by [[Kembrew McLeod]]. The paperback edition includes a foreword by [[Lawrence Lessig]]. The book was first published in 2005 by Doubleday as ''Freedom of Expression®: Overzealous Copyright Bozos and Other Enemies of Creativity'', and in 2007 by University of Minnesota Press as ''Freedom of Expression®: Resistance and Repression in the Age of Intellectual Property''. The author recounts a history of the usage of counter-cultural artistry, illegal art, and the use of copyrighted works in art as a form of fair use and creative expression. The book encourages the reader to continue such usages, in art and other forms of creative expression.

The book received a positive reception, and Kembrew McLeod was recognized by the Intellectual Freedom Round Table of the [[American Library Association]] with the [[Eli M. Oboler]] Memorial Award,<ref name=""alaaward"" /><ref name=""obolerbookaward"" /> which honors the ""best published work in the area of intellectual freedom.""<ref name=""idaho"" /> A review in ''[[The American Scholar]]'' noted, ""Kembrew McLeod ... delivers a lively, personal account of the ways intellectual property messes with people--and how he messes with intellectual property.""<ref name=""siva"" /> ''[[American Book Review]]'' characterized the work as ""a clever compendium of examples"" for those familiar with its subject matter.<ref name=""davis"" /> The ''[[Journal of Popular Culture]]'' characterized the book as ""an informative, thought-provoking, and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny examination of specific ways the privatization of ideas suppresses creativity in contemporary culture. ""<ref name=""popular"" /> ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' noted that McLeod's views echo prior comments about intellectual property by academics including Lawrence Lessig.<ref name=""publishers"" />

The book was first published by Kembrew McLeod as a collection of compiled writings,<ref>{{oclc|274113484}}</ref> in magazine format.<ref name=""perfect"" /> McLeod applied for registration of the phrase ""Freedom of Expression"" as a [[trademark]] in the [[United States]] in 1998,<ref name=""packard"">{{cite book|page=167|first=Ashley |last=Packard|title=Digital Media Law|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2010|isbn=1405181680}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Harvard Political Review|title=Freedom of Expression|publisher=John F.

''Freedom of Expression'' was first published in book form in 2005 by Doubleday as ''Freedom of Expression&reg;: Overzealous Copyright Bozos and Other Enemies of Creativity'',<ref>{{oclc|55870944}}</ref><ref>{{lccn|20|040|55289}}</ref> and in 2007 by University of Minnesota Press as ''Freedom of Expression&reg;: Resistance and Repression in the Age of Intellectual Property''.<ref>{{oclc|76961330}}</ref><ref>{{lccn|20|061|01176}}</ref> The 2005 edition of the book was made freely available via a [[Creative Commons]] license.<ref name=""popular"" /> 

The Media Education Foundation released a [[documentary film]] in the form of a DVD video in 2007 with Kembrew McLeod along with contributors including [[Jeremy Smith]], [[Sut Jhally]], and Jeremy Earp.<ref>{{oclc|181597780}}</ref><ref name=""monthlyreview"">{{cite news|url=http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2008/freedom220108.html|work=Monthly Review|publisher=Monthly Review foundation|title=Freedom of Expression&reg;|date=January 22, 2008|accessdate=2011-01-24}}</ref> The documentary film featured narration from [[Naomi Klein]], and included interviews with Lawrence Lessig, [[Siva Vaidhyanathan]] a [[University of Virginia]] academic in the field of media studies, Inga Chernyak a co-founder of Free Culture at [[New York University]], and [[Mark Hosler]] of [[Negativland]].<ref name=""monthlyreview"" />

==Contents==

McLeod discusses the concept of [[freedom of expression]] with regard to cultural norms and the manner in which society allows corporations to influence discourse.<ref name=""siva"" /> The author places himself within the context of the book, including a discussion of his own pranks such as the 1998 registration of ""freedom of expression"", and subsequent cease and desist letter to AT&T.<ref name=""siva"" /> 

''Freedom of Expression&reg;'' delves into the history of counter-cultural artistry, including recounting episodes such as [[Dadaist]] art styles, and an incident where [[Vanna White]] initiated a lawsuit against a [[robot]] likeness for [[copyright infringement]].<ref name=""davis"" /> McLeod presents an exploration of [[fair use]] and encourages the reader to utilize copyrighted works in alternative forms of artwork.<ref name=""davis"" /> He gives chronological background on the song ""[[Happy Birthday to You]]"", and information behind the use of sampling in the music industry, as well as a discussion of illegal art.<ref name=""popular"" /> The author emphasizes that the threat of a lawsuit from a company is not necessarily indication of actual criminal activity, and these threats against artistry and creativity can be overcome through determination.<ref name=""davis"" />

==Reception==
''Freedom of Expression&reg;'' was recognized in 2006 by the [[American Library Association]] (ALA) with the [[Eli M. Oboler]] Memorial Award,<ref name=""alaaward"">{{cite news|url=http://www.ala.org/ala/newspresscenter/news/pressreleases2006/may2006/mcleodgetsoboleraward.cfm|title=Kembrew McLeod receives Eli M.

In its place, the author wittily exposes a stifling shift of copyright law into an instrument of commercial interests.""<ref name=""alaaward"" /> The award was given to McLeod on behalf of the Intellectual Freedom Round Table (IFRT), a committee of the ALA.<ref name=""alaaward"" /> Kembrew McLeod was the only recipient of the Eli M.

In a review of the book for ''[[The American Scholar]]'', [[Siva Vaidhyanathan]] of [[New York University]] wrote ""Kembrew McLeod ... delivers a lively, personal account of the ways intellectual property messes with people--and how he messes with intellectual property.""<ref name=""siva"">{{cite journal|issn=0003-0937|journal=[[The American Scholar]]|title=Celestial Jukebox|first=Siva |last=Vaidhyanathan |date=Spring 2005|pages=131–135|volume=74|issue=2}}</ref> Vaidhyanathan commented on the author's writing style, ""McLeod is ironic and witty, writing with a hip-hop-influenced youth-savvy diction that demonstrates his confidence and engagement with the material and the culture that means so much to him.""<ref name=""siva"" /> [[Davis Schneiderman]] wrote positively of the work, in a review for ''[[American Book Review]]''.<ref name=""davis"">{{cite journal|journal=[[American Book Review]]|volume=27|issue=3|date=March 2006|page=11|issn=0149-9408|title=A Sample of Fair Use}}</ref> Schneiderman compared the book to similar works on the subject matter, including ''No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies'' (2000) by Naomi Klein, and writings of [[Michael Moore]] and [[Al Franken]].<ref name=""davis"" /> 

A review by [[Eric Anderson]] of [[Bowling Green State University]] writing in the ''[[Journal of Popular Culture]]''  praised the author's use of interviews throughout the book, ""''Freedom of Expression&reg;'' shines with McLeod's broad use of interviews. From legendary music engineer and producer Steve Albini to hip-hop pioneer Kool D. J. Herc, from film archivist Rick Prelinger to famed film director John Waters, McLeod records and reports the voices of creative people who have been encumbered by the contemporary intellectual property regime. The incorporation of these interviews, demonstrating as they do specific examples of creativity obstructed in specific ways, is this book's most important contribution.""<ref name=""popular"">{{cite journal|journal=[[Journal of Popular Culture]]|last=Anderson|first=Eric|volume=39|issue=1|date=February 2006|pages=152–153|issn=0022-3840|title=Freedom of Expression&reg;}}</ref> Anderson characterized the book as ""an informative, thought-provoking, and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny examination of specific ways the privatization of ideas suppresses creativity in contemporary culture. ""<ref name=""popular"" /> Anderson noted the uncommon tactic by McLeod and the book's publisher of making the book freely available via [[Creative Commons]] license.<ref name=""popular"" /> 

''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' reviewed the book and compared McLeod's tactic of following his trademarked phrase with ""&reg;"" as a satire of the registration of ""[[fair and balanced]]"" as a trademark by the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]].<ref name=""publishers"">{{cite journal|journal=[[Publishers Weekly]]|volume=251|issue=51|date=December 20, 2004|issn=0000-0019}}</ref> The review commented of the author's argumentation, ""While McLeod's arguments aren't original, his entertaining examples and punchy writing nicely amplify the concerns voiced by an increasing number of intellectual property scholars, such as Lawrence Lessig.""<ref name=""publishers"" /> The review noted regarding the author's writing style, ""Although he evokes dark, almost Orwellian images throughout, McLeod manages an upbeat spin, citing the 'egalitarian' nature of the new technologies and a growing awareness of the need to return to a place where 'freedom of expression' is once again 'a meaningful concept that guides our political, social and creative lives.'""<ref name=""publishers"" />

{{Campaignbox Italian Wars}}

The '''War of the League of Cambrai''', sometimes known as the '''War of the Holy League''' and by several other names,<ref>The conflict comprising the 1508–16 portion of the [[Italian Wars]] may be divided into three separate wars: the War of the League of Cambrai (1508–10), the War of the Holy League (1510–14), and Francis I's First Italian War (1515–16). The War of the Holy League may be further divided into the Ferrarese War (1510), the War of the Holy League proper (1511–14), an Anglo-Scottish War (1513), and an Anglo-French War (1513–14). Certain historians (notably Phillips and Axelrod) refer to each of the component wars separately, while others (notably Norwich) treat the entire conflict as a single war.</ref> was a major conflict in the [[Italian Wars]].  The principal participants of the war, which was fought from 1508 to 1516, were [[France]], the [[Papal States]], and the [[Republic of Venice]]; they were joined, at various times, by nearly every significant power in [[Western Europe]], including [[Spain]], the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the [[Kingdom of England]], the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], the [[Duchy of Milan]], [[Florence]], the [[Duchy of Ferrara]], and the [[Switzerland|Swiss]]. 

[[Pope Julius II]], intending to curb Venetian influence in northern [[History of Italy during foreign domination and the unification|Italy]], had created the League of Cambrai, an anti-Venetian alliance that included, besides himself, [[Louis XII of France]], [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I]], and [[Ferdinand I of Spain]].  Although the League was initially successful, friction between Julius and Louis caused it to collapse by 1510; Julius then allied himself with Venice against France.  

The Veneto-Papal alliance eventually expanded into the Holy League, which drove the French from Italy in 1512; disagreements about the division of the spoils, however, led Venice to abandon the alliance in favor of one with France. Under the leadership of [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], who had succeeded Louis to the throne, the French and Venetians would, through their victory at [[Battle of Marignano|Marignano]] in 1515, regain the territory they had lost; the treaties of [[Noyon]] and [[Brussels]], which ended the war the next year,  would essentially return the map of Italy to the status quo of 1508.

== Prelude ==

In the aftermath of the [[First Italian War]], [[Pope Alexander VI]] had moved to consolidate Papal control over central Italy by seizing the [[Romagna]]. [[Cesare Borgia]], acting as [[gonfaloniere]] of the Papal armies, had expelled the [[Bentivoglio]] family from [[Bologna]], which they had ruled as a fief, and was well on his way towards establishing a permanent Borgia state in the region when Alexander died on [[18 August]] [[1503]].<ref>Norwich, ''History of Venice'', 390.</ref>  Although Cesare managed to seize the remnants of the Papal treasury for his own use, he was unable to secure Rome itself, as French and Spanish armies converged on the city in an attempt to influence the [[Papal conclave]]; the election of [[Pope Pius III|Pius III]] (who soon died, to be replaced by Julius II) stripped Cesare of his titles and relegated him to commanding a company of men-at-arms.<ref>Guicciardini, ''History of Italy'', 168–175.</ref>  Sensing Cesare's weakness, the dispossessed lords of the Romagna offered to submit to the Republic of Venice in exchange for aid in regaining their dominions; the Senate accepted and had taken possession of [[Rimini]], [[Faenza]], and a number of other cities by the end of 1503.<ref>Norwich, ''History of Venice'', 391.</ref>

Julius II, having secured his own control of the Papal armies by arresting and imprisoning Cesare, first in Rome and later in Madrid, quickly moved to re-establish Papal control over the Romagna by demanding that Venice return the cities she had seized; the Republic, although willing to acknowledge Papal sovereignty over them and pay Julius an annual tribute, refused to surrender the cities themselves. In response, Julius concluded an alliance with France and the Holy Roman Empire against Venice; the death of [[Isabella of Castile]] and the resulting collapse of relations between the parties soon dissolved the alliance, but not before Venice had been induced to abandon several of the cities.<ref>Norwich, ''History of Venice'', 392.</ref> Julius, although unsatisfied with his gains, did not himself possess sufficient forces to fight the Republic; for the next two years he instead occupied himself with the reconquest of Bologna and [[Perugia]], which, located between Papal and Venetian territory, had in the meantime assumed a state of quasi-independence.<ref>Guicciardini, ''History of Italy'', 189–190.</ref>

In 1507, Julius returned to the question of the cities in Venetian hands; once again rebuffed by the Senate, he encouraged the recently elected [[Emperor Maximilian I]] to attack the Republic. Maximilian, using his journey to Rome for the Imperial coronation as a pretext, entered Venetian territory with a large army in February 1508 and advanced on [[Vicenza]], but was defeated by a Venetian army under [[Bartolomeo d'Alviano]]. A second assault by a [[Tyrol]]ean force several weeks later was an even greater failure; Alviano not only routed the Imperial army but also proceeded to seize [[Trieste]] and [[Fiume]], forcing Maximilian to conclude a truce with Venice.<ref>Norwich, ''History of Venice'', 393.</ref>

Julius, humiliated by the failure of the Imperial invasion, turned to [[Louis XII of France]] (who, having been left in possession of [[Milan]] after the [[Second Italian War]], was interested in further expansion into Italy) with an offer of alliance. In mid-March, the Republic provided a pretext for an attack on itself by appointing her own candidate to the vacant bishopric of Vicenza (an act in keeping with prevailing custom, though Julius considered it a personal provocation); the Pope proceeded to call for all Christian nations to join him in an expedition to subdue Venice.<ref>Norwich, ''History of Venice'', 394–395.</ref>  On [[10 December]] [[1508]], representatives of the Papacy, France, the Holy Roman Empire, and [[Ferdinand I of Spain]] concluded the League of Cambrai against the Republic.  The agreement provided for the complete dismemberment of Venice's territory in Italy and for its partition among the signatories: Maximilian, in addition to regaining [[Istria]], would receive [[Verona]], Vicenza, [[Padua]], and the [[Friuli]]; France would annex [[Brescia]], [[Crema]], [[Bergamo]], and [[Cremona]] to its Milanese possessions; Ferdinand would seize [[Otranto]]; and the remainder, including [[Rimini]] and [[Ravenna]], would be added to the Papal States.<ref>Guicciardini, ''History of Italy'', 196–197.</ref>

On [[15 April]] [[1509]], Louis left Milan at the head of a French army and moved rapidly into Venetian territory. To oppose him, Venice had hired a [[condottiere]] army under the command of the [[Orsini]] cousins&mdash;Bartolomeo d'Alviano and [[Nicolo di Pitigliano]]&mdash;but had failed to account for the fact that the two disagreed on how best to stop the French advance. Consequently, when Louis crossed the [[Adda River]] in early May and Alviano advanced to meet him, Pitigliano, believing it best to avoid a pitched battle, moved away to the south. On [[14 May]], Alviano confronted the French at the [[Battle of Agnadello]]; outnumbered, he sent requests for reinforcements to his cousin, who replied with orders to break off the battle and continued on his way.<ref>Taylor, ''Art of War in Italy'', 119.</ref> Alviano, disregarding the new orders, continued the engagement; his army was eventually surrounded and destroyed. Pitigliano managed to avoid encountering Louis; but his mercenary troops, hearing of Alviano's defeat, had deserted in large numbers by the next morning, forcing him to retreat to [[Treviso]] with the remnants of the Venetian army.<ref>Norwich, ''History of Venice'', 399–400.</ref>  

The Venetian collapse was complete; Louis proceeded to occupy Venetian territory as far east as [[Brescia]] without encountering any significant resistance. The major cities that had not been occupied by the French&mdash;Padua, Verona, and Vicenza&mdash;were left undefended by Pitigliano's withdrawal, and quickly surrendered to Maximilian when Imperial emissaries arrived in the Veneto.  Julius, having in the meantime issued an [[interdict]] against Venice that excommunicated every citizen of the Republic, invaded the Romagna and seized Ravenna with the assistance of the [[Alfonso I d'Este|Duke of Ferrara]], who had joined the League and seized the [[Polesine]] for himself.<ref>Norwich, ''History of Venice'', 401–402.</ref>

The newly arrived Imperial governors, however, quickly proved to be unpopular.  In mid-July, the citizens of Padua, aided by detachments of Venetian cavalry under the command of the [[proveditor]] [[Andrea Gritti]], revolted; the [[landsknechts]] garrisoning the city were too few in number to mount effective resistance and  Padua was restored to Venetian control on [[17 July]].<ref>Norwich, ''History of Venice'', 404.</ref>  The success of the revolt finally pushed Maximilian into action. In early August, a massive Imperial army, accompanied by bodies of French and Spanish troops, set out from [[Trento]] into the Veneto.  Because of a lack of horses, as well as general disorganization, Maximilian's forces would not reach Padua until September, giving Pitigliano the time to concentrate such troops as were still available to him in the city. The [[Siege of Padua]] began on [[15 September]]; although French and Imperial artillery successfully breached Padua's walls, the defenders managed to hold the city until Maximilian, growing impatient, lifted the siege on [[30 September]] and withdrew to [[Tyrol]] with the main part of his army.<ref>Norwich, ''History of Venice'', 405.</ref>

[[Image:09julius.jpg|thumb|left|230px|[[Pope Julius II]], painted by [[Raphael]] (oil on wood, c. 1511).  Julius attempted to secure Papal authority in Italy by creating the League of Cambrai, an alliance aimed at curbing Venetian power.]]

In mid-November, Pitigliano returned to the offensive; Venetian troops easily defeated the remaining Imperial forces, capturing Vicenza, [[Este]], [[Feltre]], and [[Belluno]]. Although a subsequent attack on Verona failed, Pitigliano managed to destroy a Papal army under [[Francesco II of Gonzaga]] in the process.  A [[Battle of Polesella|river attack]] on [[Ferrara]] by the Venetian [[galley]] fleet under [[Angelo Trevisan]] failed, however, when the Venetian ships, anchored in the [[Po River]], were sunk by Ferrarese artillery;<ref>Norwich, ''History of Venice'', 406.</ref> and a new French advance soon forced Pitigliano to withdraw to Padua once again.

Faced with a shortage of both funds and men, the Senate decided to send an embassy to Julius in order to negotiate a settlement. The terms insisted on by the Pope were harsh: the Republic lost her traditional power to appoint clergy in her territory, as well as all jurisdiction over Papal subjects in Venice, the Romagnan cities that had prompted the war were to be returned to Julius, and reparations were to be paid to cover his expenses in capturing them. The Senate argued over the terms for two months, but finally accepted them on February 24, 1510. Even before the Venetian ambassadors had presented themselves to Julius for [[absolution]], however, the [[Council of Ten]] had privately resolved that the terms had been accepted under duress and were therefore invalid; and that Venice should violate them at the earliest opportunity.<ref>Norwich, ''History of Venice'', 408–409.</ref>

This reconciliation between Venice and the Pope did not stop the French from again invading the Veneto in March. Pitigliano's death in January had left Andrea Gritti in command of the Venetian forces; although Maximilian failed to reinforce Louis, the French army was nonetheless sufficient to drive the Venetians from Vicenza by May.  Gritti garrisoned Padua for an expected attack by a combined Franco-Imperial army; but Louis, more concerned by the death of his advisor, the [[Cardinal d'Amboise]], abandoned his plans for a siege.<ref>Norwich, ''History of Venice'', 410–411.</ref>

== Veneto-Papal alliance (1510–11) ==

Julius, meanwhile, had become increasingly concerned by the growing French presence in Italy; more significantly, he had formulated plans to seize the [[Duchy of Ferrara]], a French ally, and to add its territory to the Papal States.  His own forces being inadequate for the venture, the Pope hired an army of [[Swiss mercenaries]], ordering them to attack the French in Milan; he also invited Venice to ally with him against Louis. The Republic, facing a renewed French onslaught, readily accepted the offer.

[[Image:Alfonso I d'Este.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Alphonso d'Este|Alfonso d'Este]], the Duke of [[Ferrara]]; excommunicated by Julius, he inflicted a number of defeats on the Papal forces.]]

By July 1510, the new Veneto-Papal alliance was on the offensive.  An initial attack on French-occupied [[Genoa]] failed, but Venetian troops under [[Lucio Malvezzo]] finally drove the French from [[Vicenza]] in early August; and a joint force commanded by [[Francesco Maria I della Rovere|Francesco Maria della Rovere]], the Duke of [[Urbino]], captured [[Modena]] on [[17 August]]. Julius now [[excommunication|excommunicated]] [[Alfonso d'Este]], thus justifying an attack on the [[Duchy of Ferrara|Duchy]] itself; in anticipation of his coming victory, the Pope traveled to [[Bologna]], so as to be nearby when Ferrara was taken.<ref>Norwich, ''History of Venice'', 415.</ref>

The French army, however, had been left unopposed by the Swiss (who, having arrived in Lombardy, had been bribed into leaving by Louis) and was free to march south into the heart of Italy. In early October, [[Charles d'Amboise]] advanced on Bologna, splitting the Papal forces; by [[18 October]], he was only a few miles from the city.  Julius now realized that the Bolognese were openly hostile to the Papacy and would not offer any resistance to the French; left with only a detachment of Venetian cavalry, he resorted to excommunicating d'Amboise, who had in the meantime been convinced by the English ambassador to avoid attacking the person of the Pope and had thus withdrawn to Ferrara.<ref>Norwich, ''History of Venice'', 417.</ref>

In December, a newly assembled Papal army besieged the fortress of [[Mirandola]]; d'Amboise, marching to relieve it, fell ill and died, briefly leaving the French in disarray.<ref>Guicciardini, ''History of Italy'', 216.</ref>  Alfonso d'Este, meanwhile, confronted and destroyed the Venetian forces on the [[Po River]], leaving Bologna isolated once more.  Julius, afraid of being trapped by the French, departed the city for Ravenna.  Cardinal Alidosi, whom he left behind to command the defense of the city, was no better liked by the Bolognese than Julius himself had been; and when, on [[23 May]] [[1511]], a French army commanded by [[Gian Giacomo Trivulzio]] arrived at the gates, they quickly surrendered. Julius blamed this defeat on the Duke of Urbino, who, finding this quite unfair, proceeded to murder Alidosi in full view of the Papal guard.<ref>Guicciardini, ''History of Italy'', 227.</ref>

== Holy League (1511–13) ==

By June 1511, most of the Romagna was in French hands; the Papal army, disorganized and underpaid, was in no condition to prevent Trivulzio from advancing on Ravenna.  In response to this debacle, Julius proclaimed a Holy League against France.  The new alliance rapidly grew to include not only Spain and the Holy Roman Empire, who abandoned any pretense of adhering to the League of Cambrai in hopes of seizing [[Navarre]] and Lombardy from Louis, but also [[Henry VIII of England]] (who, having decided to use the occasion as an excuse to expand his holdings in northern France, concluded the Treaty of Westminster—a pledge of mutual aid against the French—with Ferdinand in November 1511).

[[Image:The Death of Gaston de Foix in the Battle of Ravenna.jpg|thumb|left|270px|The death of [[Gaston de Foix]] during the [[Battle of Ravenna (1512)|Battle of Ravenna]] heralded a long period of defeats for France.]]

In February 1512, Louis appointed his nephew, [[Gaston de Foix]], to command the French forces in Italy.  Foix proved more energetic than Amboise had been; having checked the advance of [[Ramón de Cardona]]'s Spanish troops on Bologna, he returned to Lombardy to [[Sack of Brescia|sack Brescia]], which had rebelled against the French and garrisoned itself with Venetian troops.  Aware that much of the French army would be diverted to deal with the impending English invasion, Foix and Alfonso d'Este besieged [[Ravenna]], the last Papal stronghold in the Romagna, in hopes of forcing the Holy League into a decisive engagement.<ref>Guicciardini, ''History of Italy'', 244.</ref>  Cardona marched to relieve the city in early April, and was decisively beaten in the resulting [[Battle of Ravenna (1512)|Battle of Ravenna]]; the death of Foix during the fighting, however, left the French under the command of [[Jacques de la Palice]], who, unwilling to continue the campaign without direct orders from Louis, contented himself with thoroughly sacking Ravenna.<ref>Norwich, ''History of Venice'', 422.</ref>

By May 1512, the French position had deteriorated considerably.  Julius had hired another army of Swiss mercenaries; they descended on Milan, bringing with them [[Maximilian Sforza]], who was determined to regain control of the [[Duchy of Milan|Duchy]] for his family.  La Palice abandoned the Romagna (where the Duke of Urbino quickly captured Bologna and [[Parma]]) and retreated to Lombardy, attempting to intercept the invasion.  By August, the Swiss had combined with the Venetian army and forced Triviulzio out of Milan, allowing Sforza to be proclaimed Duke with their support; La Palice was then forced to withdraw across the Alps.<ref>Norwich, ''History of Venice'', 423–424; Oman, ''Art of War'', 152.</ref>

In late August, the members of the League met at [[Mantua]] to discuss the situation in Italy (particularly the partition of territory acquired from the French).  They quickly came to an agreement regarding [[Florence]], which had angered Julius by allowing Louis to convene the [[Council of Pisa]] in its territory.  At the Pope's request, Ramon de Cardona marched into [[Tuscany]], smashed Florentine resistance, overthrew the Republic, and installed Cardinal [[Giuliano di Lorenzo de' Medici|Giuliano de' Medici]] as ruler of the city.<ref>Hibbert, ''Florence'', 168.</ref>

On the subject of territory, however, fundamental disagreements quickly arose.  Julius and the Venetians insisted that Maximilian Sforza be permitted to keep the Duchy of Milan; Emperor Maximilian and Ferdinand conspired instead to have one of their cousins installed as duke.  The Pope demanded the immediate annexation of Ferrara to the Papal States; Ferdinand objected to this arrangement, desiring the existence of an independent Ferrara to counter growing Papal power.  Most problematic, however, was the attitude of Maximilian towards Venice.  The Emperor refused to surrender any Imperial territory, which in his eyes included most of the Veneto, to the Republic; to this end, he signed an agreement with the Pope to exclude Venice entirely from the final partition.  When the Republic objected, Julius threatened to reform the League of Cambrai against her. In response, Venice turned to Louis; on [[23 March]] [[1513]], a treaty pledging to divide all of northern Italy between France and the Republic was signed at [[Blois]].<ref>Norwich, ''History of Venice'', 425.</ref>

== Franco-Venetian alliance (1513–16) ==

In late May 1513, a French army commanded by [[Louis de la Trémoille]] crossed the [[Alps]] and advanced on Milan; at the same time, Bartolomeo d'Alviano and the Venetian army marched west from Padua.  The unpopularity of Maximilian Sforza, who was seen by the Milanese as a puppet of his Swiss mercenaries, enabled the French to move through Lombardy with little resistance; Trémoille, having seized Milan, besieged the remaining Swiss in [[Novara]].  On [[6 June]], the French were attacked by a Swiss relief army at the [[Battle of Novara (1513)|Battle of Novara]], and were routed despite having superior numbers.<ref>Oman, ''Art of War'', 153–154; Taylor, ''Art of War in Italy'', 123.</ref>  Detachments of the Swiss army pursued the fleeing French over the Alps and had reached [[Dijon]] before being bribed into withdrawing.<ref>Goubert, ''Course of French History'', 135.</ref>

The rout at Novara inaugurated a period of continuous defeats for the French alliance.  English troops under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] attacked La Palice at the [[Battle of the Spurs|Battle of Guinegate]], scattered the French forces, and proceeded to sack [[Thérouanne]].  In Navarre, resistance to Ferdinand's invasion collapsed; he rapidly consolidated his hold over the entire region and moved to support another English offensive in the [[Guyenne]].<ref>Kamen, ''Empire'', 35.</ref>  [[James IV of Scotland]] invaded England at the behest of Louis;<ref>Guicciardini, ''History of Italy'', 280.</ref> but he failed to draw Henry's attention from France, and his death—and the Scots' disastrous defeat—at the [[Battle of Flodden Field]] on [[9 September]] [[1513]], ended Scotland's brief involvement in the war.  

[[Image:Marignano.JPG|270px|thumb|right|In 1515, the Franco-Venetian alliance decisively defeated the Holy League  at the [[Battle of Marignano]].]]

Meanwhile, Alviano, unexpectedly left without French support, retreated into the Veneto, pursued closely by the Spanish army under Cardona. While the Spanish were unable to capture Padua in the face of determined Venetian resistance, they penetrated deep into Venetian territory and by late September were in sight of [[Venice]] itself.  Cardona attempted a bombardment of the city that proved largely ineffective; then, having no boats with which to cross the lagoon, turned back for Lombardy. Alviano, having been reinforced by hundreds of volunteers from the Venetian nobility, pursued Cardona and confronted him outside [[Vicenza]] on [[7 October]]. In the resulting [[Battle of La Motta]], the Venetian army was decisively defeated, with many prominent noblemen cut down outside the city walls as they attempted to flee.<ref>Norwich, ''History of Venice'', 429.</ref>

However, the Holy League failed to follow up on these victories.  Cardona and Alviano continued to skirmish in the [[Friuli]] for the rest of 1513 and through 1514, fighting several inconclusive battles, but Cardona was unable to make any real progress. Henry VIII, having failed to gain any significant territory, concluded a separate peace with France.<ref>Guicciardini, ''History of Italy'', 282.</ref>  Finally, the death of Julius left the League without a leader; Julius' successor to the Papacy, [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]], was rather less concerned with military matters.

The death of Louis XII on [[1 January]] [[1515]], brought [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] to the throne. Having assumed the title of [[Duke of Milan]] at his coronation, Francis immediately moved to reclaim his holdings in Italy. By July, Francis had assembled an army in the [[Dauphiné]]. A combined Swiss and Papal force moved north from Milan to block the Alpine passes against him, but Francis, following the advice of Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, avoided the main passes and marched instead through the valley of the [[Stura]].<ref>Norwich, ''History of Venice'', 430.</ref>  The French vanguard surprised the Milanese cavalry at [[Villafranca]], capturing [[Prospero Colonna]];<ref>Taylor, ''Art of War in Italy'', 67.</ref> meanwhile, Francis and the main body of the French confronted the Swiss at the [[Battle of Marignano]] on [[13 September]]. The Swiss advance initially made headway; however, Francis' superiority in cavalry and artillery, together with the timely arrival of Alviano (who had successfully avoided Cardona's army at [[Verona]]) on the morning of [[14 September]], led to a strategically decisive victory for Francis and the Venetians.<ref>Norwich, ''History of Venice'', 431.</ref>

== Aftermath ==

After the defeat at Marignano, the League no longer possessed the ability or the will to continue the war. Francis advanced on Milan, capturing the city on [[4 October]] and removing Sforza from the throne.  In December, he met with Leo at Bologna; the pope, who had in the meantime been deserted by the remainder of his [[Swiss mercenaries]], surrendered [[Parma]] and [[Piacenza]] to Francis and [[Modena]] to the [[Duke of Ferrara]].<ref>Guicciardini, ''History of Italy'', 290.</ref> In return, Leo received guarantees of French noninterference in his proposed attack on the [[Duchy of Urbino]]. Finally, the Treaty of Noyon, signed by Francis and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in August 1516, recognized French claims to Milan and Spanish claims to Naples, removing Spain from the war.    

Maximilian held out, making another attempt to invade Lombardy; his army failed to reach Milan before turning back, and by December 1516, he had entered into negotiations with Francis. The resulting Treaty of Brussels not only accepted French occupation of Milan, but also confirmed Venetian claims to the remainder of the Imperial possessions in Lombardy (except for [[Cremona]]), effectively ending the war with a return to the status quo of 1508.<ref>Norwich, ''History of Venice'', 432.</ref> The peace, however, would last only four years; the election of Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor in 1519 caused Francis, who had desired the position for himself, to begin the [[Italian War of 1521–26]]. The [[Italian Wars]], thus reignited, would then continue until 1530 without significant interruption.

==Chemistry==
Amygdalin is extracted from almonds or apricot kernels by boiling in [[ethanol]]; on evaporation of the solution and the addition of [[diethyl ether]], amygdalin is precipitated as white minute crystals. Liebig and Wöhler were already able to find three decomposition products of the newly discovered amygdalin: sugar, [[benzaldehyde]], and prussic acid ([[hydrogen cyanide]]).<ref>{{cite journal

Several [[glucosidase]] [[enzyme]]s are known to act on amygdalin, leading to its decomposition by various pathways. [[Maltase]] causes partial degradation, giving <small>D</small>-glucose and [[mandelic nitrile glucoside]], C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CH(CN)O·C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>11</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. [[Emulsin]], on the other hand, decomposes it into [[benzaldehyde]], [[cyanide]], and two molecules of [[glucose]]; this [[enzyme]] occurs in the [[bitter almond]], and consequently the seeds invariably contain free cyanide and benzaldehyde.  An ""[[Amorphous solid|amorphous]] amygdalin"" is said to occur in the cherry laurel (''[[Prunus laurocerasus]]''). Lastly, [[amygdalin beta-glucosidase]] and [[prunasin beta-glucosidase]] consecutively catalyze loss of the two glucose units to yield [[mandelonitrile]], which can then decompose to form free cyanide and benzaldehyde. One gram of amygdalin would release 68&nbsp;mg of hydrogen cyanide if fully decomposed along this route.

Natural amygdalin has the ''R'' configuration at the [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] [[benzyl]] center. Under mild basic conditions, this stereogenic center [[epimerizes]]; the ''S'' epimer is called '''neoamygdalin'''.<ref name=fenselau/>

Amygdalin is sometimes confused with '''laevomandelonitrile''', also called '''laetrile''' for short; however, amygdalin and laetrile are different [[chemical compound]]s.<ref name=fenselau>{{cite journal |author=Fenselau C, Pallante S, Batzinger RP |title=Mandelonitrile beta-glucuronide: synthesis and characterization |journal=Science |volume=198 |issue=4317 |pages=625–7 |date=November 1977 |pmid=335509 |doi=10.1126/science.335509 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=335509}}</ref> Laetrile, which was patented in the United States, is a [[semi-synthetic]] molecule sharing part of the amygdalin structure, while the ""laetrile"" made in Mexico is usually amygdalin, the [[natural product]] obtained from crushed apricot pits, or neoamygdalin.<ref name=ncifaq>[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/laetrile/patient/allpages#Section_20 What is laetrile?], [[National Cancer Institute]], Retrieved on 14 January 2007</ref>

Though it is sometimes sold as ""Vitamin B<sub>17</sub>"", it is not a [[vitamin]]. Amygdalin/laetrile was claimed to be a vitamin by chemist [[Ernst T.

==Toxicity==
The metabolism of amygdalin produces [[hydrogen cyanide]], a potent toxin. [[Amygdalin beta-glucosidase|Beta-glucosidase]], one of the enzymes that catalyzes the release of cyanide from amygdalin, is present in the human small intestine and in a variety of common foods. This leads to an unpredictable and potentially lethal toxicity when amygdalin or laetrile is taken orally.<ref name=CaCancer/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Newmark J, Brady RO, Grimley PM, Gal AE, Waller SG, Thistlethwaite JR |title=Amygdalin (Laetrile) and prunasin beta-glucosidases: distribution in germ-free rat and in human tumor tissue |journal=Proc.

Some laetrile promoters have claimed that the cyanide generated by laetrile is immediately harmlessly detoxified by the [[mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] enzyme [[rhodanese]] into [[thiocyanate]]. However, these claims are false. First, because thiocyanate is also toxic, although to a lesser degree. Second, the body only can use the small amount of rhodanese that is present in the blood, regardless of the stores present in kidneys and liver. Third, the limited factor in this conversion are the stores of [[cystine]], [[cysteine]], and other sulfur compounds, which are rapidly depleted in laetrile poisoning. Fourth, blood analysis shows undetoxified cyanide in persons poisoned with laetrile or with apricot kernels.<ref name=""ajcn""/>

==Cancer treatment==
Amygdalin was first isolated in 1830. In 1845 it was used as a cancer treatment in Russia, and in the 1920s in the United States, but it was considered too poisonous.<ref name=CancerInstitute/> In the 1950s, a purportedly non-toxic, synthetic form was patented for use as a meat preservative,<ref name=patent>{{Cite patent| inventor-last = Krebs | inventor-first =Ernst T. | inventor2-last =Krebs, Jr. | inventor2-first =Ernst T. | date = May 23, 1961 | title = Hexuronic acid derivatives | url = http://www.freepatentsonline.com/2985664.html | country-code = US | patent-number = 2985664 |author=E Krebs}}</ref> and later marketed as laetrile for cancer treatment.<ref name=CancerInstitute/>

The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] prohibited the interstate shipment of amygdalin and laetrile in 1977.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carpenter|first=Daniel|title= Reputation and Power: Organizational Image and Pharmaceutical Regulation at the FDA.

=== Initial studies at Sloan-Kettering ===
In 1972, [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]] (MSKCC) board member [[Benno C. Schmidt, Sr.]] convinced the hospital to test laetrile so that he could assure others of its ineffectiveness ""with some conviction.""<ref name=Wade1977/> [[Kanematsu Sugiura]], the scientist who performed the requested tests, found that laetrile inhibited secondary tumors in mice, though it did not destroy the primary tumors. He repeated the experiment several times with the same results. However, three other researchers were unable to [[reproducibility|confirm]] Sugiura's results. While these uncontrolled and inconclusive results were considered too preliminary to publish, they were leaked to laetrile advocates, resulting in significant public attention.<ref name=""Wade1977""/>

To expand on Sugiura's results, MSKCC researchers conducted a [[Scientific control|controlled]] experiment in which they injected some mice with laetrile (as Sugiura had done) and others with [[placebo]]. Sugiura, who was [[Double-blind#Double-blind trials|unaware of which mice had received laetrile]], performed the pathologic analysis. In this controlled, blinded follow-up of Sugiura's initial uncontrolled experiment, laetrile showed no more activity than placebo.<ref name=""Wade1977""/>

Subsequently, laetrile was tested on 14 tumor systems without evidence of effectiveness. Given this collection of results, MSKCC concluded that ""laetrile showed no beneficial effects.""<ref name=Wade1977/> Mistakes in the MSKCC press release were highlighted by a group of laetrile proponents led by [[Ralph W. Moss (science writer)|Ralph Moss]], former public affairs official of MSKCC who was fired following his appearance at a press conference accusing the hospital of covering up the benefits of laetrile.<ref name=""Budiansky1995"">{{cite news | first=Stephen | last=Budiansky |authorlink= | title=Cures or Quackery: How Senator Harkin shaped federal research on alternative medicine | date=1995-07-09 | publisher= | url =http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/950717/archive_032434.htm | work =U.S. News & World Report | pages = | accessdate = 2009-11-07 | language = }}</ref> These mistakes were considered scientifically inconsequential, but Nicholas Wade in ''Science'' stated that ""even the appearance of a departure from strict objectivity is unfortunate.""<ref name=Wade1977>{{cite journal |author=Wade N |title=Laetrile at Sloan-Kettering: A Question of Ambiguity |journal=Science |volume=198 |issue=4323 |pages=1231–4 |date=December 1977 |pmid=17741690 |doi=10.1126/science.198.4323.1231 }}</ref> The results from these studies were published all together.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stock CC, Tarnowski GS, Schmid FA, Hutchison DJ, Teller MN |title=Antitumor tests of amygdalin in transplantable animal tumor systems |journal=J Surg Oncol |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=81–8 |year=1978 |pmid=642516 |doi=10.1002/jso.2930100202}}<br/>

=== Subsequent clinical studies ===

A 2011 [[systematic review]] from the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] found: {{quotation|The claims that laetrile or amygdalin have beneficial effects for cancer patients are not currently supported by sound clinical data. There is a considerable risk of serious adverse effects from cyanide poisoning after laetrile or amygdalin, especially after oral ingestion. The risk–benefit balance of laetrile or amygdalin as a treatment for cancer is therefore unambiguously negative.<ref name=sr2011>{{cite journal |author=Milazzo S, Ernst E, Lejeune S, Boehm K, Horneber M |title=Laetrile treatment for cancer |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=11 |pages=CD005476 |year=2011 |pmid=22071824 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005476.pub3 |type=Systematic review}}</ref>}}

The authors also recommended, on ethical grounds, that no further clinical research into laetrile or amygdalin be conducted.<ref name=sr2011/>

Given the lack of evidence, laetrile has not been approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]].<ref name=ncifaq/>

The U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] evaluated the evidence separately and concluded that clinical trials of amygdalin showed little or no effect against cancer.<ref name =CancerInstitute>[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/laetrile/patient/allpages#Section_20 Laetrile/Amygdalin – National Cancer Institute]</ref> For example, a 1982 trial of 175 patients found that tumor size had increased in all but one patient.<ref>http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/about-cancer/treatment/complementary-alternative/therapies/laetrile</ref> The authors reported that ""the hazards of amygdalin therapy were evidenced in several patients by symptoms of cyanide toxicity or by blood cyanide levels approaching the lethal range.""<ref name=Moertel82/> The investigators found that intravenous and oral amygdalin showed minimal toxicity under the conditions evaluated; however, two patients who ate raw almonds while undergoing oral treatment developed symptoms of cyanide poisoning.<ref>http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/laetrile/patient/Page2#Section_24</ref>

The study concluded ""Patients exposed to this agent should be instructed about the danger of cyanide poisoning, and their blood cyanide levels should be carefully monitored. Amygdalin (Laetrile) is a toxic drug that is not effective as a cancer treatment"".

The Mayo Clinic also conducted a study <ref>http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/laetrile/patient/Page2#Section_24</ref>

Additionally,  ""No controlled clinical trials (trials that compare groups of patients who receive the new treatment to groups who do not) of laetrile have been reported."" <ref>http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/laetrile/patient/Page2#Section_24</ref>

The side effects of laetrile treatment are the symptoms of cyanide poisoning. These symptoms include: Nausea and vomiting, Headache, Dizziness, Blue color of the skin due to a lack of oxygen in the blood, Liver damage, Abnormally low blood pressure, Droopy upper eyelid, Trouble walking due to damaged nerves, Fever, Mental confusion, Coma, Death.

=== Advocacy and legality ===

Laetrile was proven clinically ineffective more than 30 years ago and is considered a canonical example of ""[[quackery]]"".<ref name=CaCancer/> Nonetheless, advocates for laetrile dispute this label, asserting that there is a conspiracy between the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the [[pharmaceutical industry]] and the medical community, including the [[American Medical Association]] and the [[American Cancer Society]], to exploit the American people, and especially cancer patients. Advocates of the use of laetrile have also changed the rationale for its use, first as a treatment of cancer, then as a vitamin, then as part of a ""holistic"" nutritional regimen, or as treatment for cancer pain, among others, none of which have any significant evidence supporting its use.  Despite the lack of evidence for its use, laetrile developed a significant following due to its wide promotion as a ""pain-free"" treatment of cancer as an alternative to [[surgery]] and [[chemotherapy]] that have significant side effects. The use of laetrile in place of known effective treatments of cancer led to a number of deaths.<ref name=ConsumerReports>{{Cite book  | last = Editors of Consumer Reports Books | title = Health Quackery | place = Vernon, New York | publisher = Consumers Union | year = 1980 | chapter = Laetrile: the Political Success of a Scientific Failure | pages = 16–40 | isbn = 0-89043-014-4  | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

'''Kingsley Plantation''' (also known as the Zephaniah Kingsley Plantation Home and Buildings) is the site of a former [[plantation]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. Named for an early owner named [[Zephaniah Kingsley]] who spent 25 years there, it is located at the northern tip of [[Fort George Island Cultural State Park|Fort George Island]] at Fort George Inlet, and is part of the [[Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve]] managed by the U.S. [[National Park Service]]. 

The plantation was originally {{convert|1000|acre|km2}}, most of which has been taken over by forest; the structures and grounds of the park now comprise approximately 60 acres.<ref>Carter,  John (October 20, 2004). ""Slave history event at Kingsley site: Plantation having 'a sort of family reunion'."" ''Florida Times-Union'' (Jacksonville), p. N-1.</ref> Evidence of Pre-Columbian [[Timucua]] life is on the island, as are the [[Spanish missions in Florida|remains of a Spanish mission]] named ''San Juan del Puerto''. Under British rule in 1765, a plantation was established that cycled through several owners while Florida was transferred back to Spain and then the United States. The longest span of ownership was under Kingsley and his family, a [[polygamy|polygamous]] and [[multiracial]] household controlled by and resistant to the issues of race and [[slavery]]. 

Freed slaves and several private owners lived at the plantation until it was transferred to the State of Florida in 1955. It was acquired by the National Park Service in 1991. The most prominent features of Kingsley Plantation are the owner's house—a structure of architectural significance built probably between 1797 and 1798—and an attached kitchen house, barn, and remains of 25 anthropologically valuable slave cabins that endured beyond the [[U.S. Civil War]] (1861–1865). The foundations of the house and kitchen, and the barn and slave quarters were constructed of cement [[tabby cement|tabby]], making them notably durable. Archeological evidence has been found in and around the slave cabins that has given researchers insight into African traditions among slaves who had recently arrived in North America. Zephaniah Kingsley wrote a defense of slavery and a three-tier social system that acknowledged the rights of free people of color; the site is also significant as his home and that of his unique family.

==History==
===Pre-Columbian settlement and colonization===
[[File:Fort George Island shell mound.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Black and white photo of a mound of oyster shells, approximately 20 feet high, covered by vines at the top and the middle exposed. A wooden wheelbarrow sits in front of it.|Shell mound left by [[Timucua]] inhabitants of Fort George Island used as building material at Kingsley Plantation]]
Fort George Island is located in [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]], several miles east of downtown [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]]. It is a marsh island at the mouth of the [[St. Johns River]], surrounded by [[estuary|tidal estuaries]], [[Little Talbot Island]], and the Nassau River.<ref>Stowell, p. 2.</ref> The north Atlantic coast of Florida had been inhabited for approximately 12,000 years when Spanish explorer [[Juan Ponce de León]] landed near [[Cape Canaveral]] in 1513. The Spanish met the [[Saturiwa]] tribe of people speaking [[Timucua]] who were the largest group of [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous people]] in the region, numbering about 14,000. Bands of Timucua extended into central Florida, and their societies were complex with large villages sustained by fishing, hunting, and agriculture, but they frequently warred with each other and unrelated groups of Native Americans.<ref>Stowell, p. 5.</ref> The Spanish concentrated their efforts of exploration and settlement on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast of Florida]]. By 1562, [[Jean Ribault]] led French explorers to the mouth of the St. Johns River where they built a garrison in 1564, calling it [[Fort Caroline]]. Within 200 years the population of the indigenous people of Florida was decimated by disease and constant fighting.<ref name=""stowell15-21"">Stowell, pp. 15–21.</ref> They left behind evidence of their existence in massive [[midden]]s or shell mounds filled with discarded food byproducts. On Fort George Island, the shells were primarily oysters.

Ownership of Florida transferred to the United Kingdom in 1763. Spanish settlers had established missions—including one on Fort George Island named ''[[San Juan del Puerto, Florida|San Juan del Puerto]]'' that eventually gave the nearby St. Johns River its name—but their frequent battles with the Timucua and a decline in mission activity curbed development.<ref name=""stowell15-21""/><ref>Gannon, p. 57.</ref> When the British controlled Florida, they established several plantations in the region. Richard Hazard owned the first plantation on Fort George Island in 1765, harvesting [[Indigo dye|indigo]] with several dozen slaves. Spain regained ownership of Florida in 1783 after the [[American Revolution]] and recruited new Americans with promises of free land.<ref>Stowell, p. 27.</ref>

In 1793, American Revolution veteran John ""Lightning"" McQueen (1751–1807) was lured to Fort George Island from [[South Carolina]] by the Spanish government, who rewarded McQueen with the island. McQueen settled with 300 slaves and constructed a large house in a unique architectural style exhibiting four corner pavilions surrounding a great room. McQueen was soon bankrupt due to misfortunes, and the possession of the plantation turned over to John McIntosh (1773–1836) from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] who revived it in 1804.<ref>Stowell and Tilford, pp. 4–6.</ref> McIntosh, however, took a leading role in the [[Patriot Rebellion]], an attempt by Americans to hasten the annex of Florida to the United States. The rebellion was unsuccessful, and McIntosh fled back into Georgia to escape punishment from the Spanish.<ref>Stowell and Tilford, p. 7.</ref>

===Kingsley's family===
Born in [[Bristol, England]] and educated in [[Colonial period of South Carolina|colonial South Carolina]], [[Zephaniah Kingsley]] (1765–1843) established his career as a slave trader and shipping magnate, which allowed him to travel widely.<ref name=""may""/> He settled on Fort George Island in 1814 after leasing it from McIntosh. He purchased the land and buildings for $7,000 in 1817 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|7000|1817|2009|r=0}}}} in 2009). Kingsley owned several plantations around the mouth of the St. Johns River in what is today Jacksonville, and [[Drayton Island]] in central Florida; two of them were managed by his wife, a former slave named [[Anna Kingsley|Anna Madgigine Jai]] (1793–1870).<ref name=""may""/> Kingsley married Anna in 1806 when she was 13 years old, recently arrived in Cuba from West Africa.<ref>Schafer (1997), p. 11.</ref> He freed her in 1811 and charged her with running his Laurel Grove plantation at [[Doctors Lake]] in modern-day [[Orange Park, Florida|Orange Park]].

Anna Jai remained the [[matriarch]] in the polygamous family.<ref group=note>Kingsley was often away on business, during which Anna Jai would assume management responsibilities for the plantation. Anna Jai befriended a white woman named Susan L'Engle, who came from [[Fernandina Beach, Florida|Fernandina]] to visit Kingsley on business, and spent time with Anna Jai. Kingsley's absence, and his time spent with his other wives gave L'Engle the impression that Anna Jai was lonely at Fort George Island, despite all her responsibilities. Susan L'Engle told her stories to her great granddaughter, children's author [[Madeleine L'Engle]], who wrote them in her book ''Summer of the Great Grandmother''. Anna Jai is referred to as ""the African Princess"" in the book; there is some belief that Anna Jai may have been the daughter of a ruling family in West Africa. (Schafer, pp. 5, 15–18, 58.)</ref> Visitors to the plantation were invited to a multiracial dinner table where Kingsley displayed his children with pride; he provided them with the best education he could afford and considered them a shield from any potential racial uprising.<ref name=""may""/>

Authors of an ethnological study of slavery at Kingsley Plantation characterized Kingsley as a man of complex paradoxes, defiantly proud of his success as a slaveholder, yet dedicated to his multiracial family.<ref>Jackson and Burns, p. v.</ref> Kingsley, credited as ""An Inhabitant of Florida"",  published a defense of slavery in 1828, rationalizing it as a necessary condition for any society, beneficial to owner and slave alike, and to the overall economy.<ref name=""kingsley"">Kingsley (1829)</ref> He did not consider race the only factor that should determine servitude status, writing ""Few, I think will deny that color and condition, if properly considered, are two very separate qualities ... our legislators ... have mistaken the shadow for the substance, and confounded together two very different things; thereby substantiating by law a dangerous and inconvenient antipathy, which can have no better foundation than prejudice.""<ref name=""kingsley""/> President [[James Monroe]] appointed Kingsley to Florida's Territorial Council in 1823 and Kingsley watched the council pass laws that increasingly restricted the rights free blacks enjoyed under Spanish control. The treatise was Kingsley's response to these restrictions, as he favored the Spanish three-tier system of white landowners, black slaves, and freed blacks.<ref name=""kingsley""/><ref>Schafer (1997), p. 39.</ref> The pamphlet was released again in 1834, and was used to defend slavery in debates leading to the Civil War. 

The Florida Territorial Council passed laws forbidding [[interracial marriage]] and the right of free blacks or mixed race descendants to inherit property. To avoid difficulties with the new government in what he termed ""spirit of intolerant prejudice"", Kingsley sent his wives, children, and a few slaves to [[Haiti]], a free black republic.<ref name=""brochure"">[http://www.nps.gov/timu/planyourvisit/upload/kp_freedomandslavery.pdf Kingsley Plantation: Freedom and Slavery in Plantation-era Florida""] (brochure), [[National Park Service]].

(Fretwell, p. 5.)</ref> Kingsley started a plantation in Haiti which was worked by former Fort George Island slaves, who had become [[indentured servant]]s; slavery was not allowed in Haiti.<ref name=""tilford""/> In 1842 Kingsley gave an interview to an [[abolitionist]] named [[Lydia Child]]. When she asked him if he was aware that his occupation as a slave trader might be perceived as being akin to piracy, he responded ""Yes; and I am glad of it. They will look upon a slaveholder just so, by and by. Slave trading was a very respectable business when I was young. The first merchants in England and America were engaged in it. Some people hide things which they think other people don’t like. I never conceal anything.""<ref>Jackson and Burns, p. 15.</ref> 

He went on to exhibit considerable pride in the Haitian plantation built with the help of his sons: <blockquote>I wish you would go there. [Anna] would give you the best in the house. You ''ought'' to go, to see how happy the human race can be. It is a fine, rich valley, about thirty miles from Port Platte; heavily timbered with mahogany all round; well watered; flowers so beautiful; fruits in abundance, so delicious that you could not refrain from stopping to eat, till you could eat no more. My sons have laid out good roads, and built bridges and mills; the people are improving, and everything is prosperous.<ref name=""jackson17""/></blockquote>

Anna Jai moved with about 70 former slaves to the Arlington neighborhood of Jacksonville to live out her remaining years. The ownership of the island and farms immediately following its sale by Gibbs is unknown, but by the late 1860s, the [[Freedman's Bureau]] managed the island and recently emancipated freedmen lived in the former slave quarters and farmed the land.<ref>Stowell and Tilford, pp. 16–17.</ref> A New Hampshire farmer named John Rollins came to own the island in 1869, and finding agriculture in Florida not as successful as he wished, transitioned the island into a tourist resort, building a large luxury hotel and attracting celebrities such as banker [[William Astor]] and writer [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]. The slave quarters were displayed as tourist attractions. After the hotel burned down in 1888, the Rollins family successfully cultivated citrus until a freeze in 1894 destroyed their crop. Rollins' daughter's family was the last to live in the main house; she sold the island to private investors in 1923.<ref>Stowell and Tilford, pp. 19–20.</ref>

Two clubs were constructed on the island for wealthy Jacksonville residents. One used the plantation house as a headquarters until they constructed their own building. Private cubs were popular until the [[Great Depression]] and they subsequently went out of fashion during World War II. The [[Florida State Park|Florida Park Service]] acquired most of Fort George Island in 1955, including the plantation houses, barn, and slave quarters, calling it the Kingsley Plantation State Historic Site. An effort to restore the property to its appearance while the Kingsley family was in residence began in 1967.<ref>Jackson and Burns, p. 5.</ref> The [[Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve]] was created by the [[National Park Service]] and established under President [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1988. Several sites, including Fort Caroline and other ecologically significant properties in Jacksonville, are under the management of the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve. Kingsley Plantation was transferred to the National Park Service in 1991.<ref>Stowell and Tilford, p. 21.</ref>

==Slavery on Fort George Island==

Labor at Kingsley Plantation was carried out by the task system: each slave was given an assigned set of tasks for the day, such processing {{convert|20|-|30|lb|abbr=on}} of cotton or constructing three barrels for a slave who was a [[cooper (profession)|cooper]]. When the day's jobs were completed, slaves were free to do as they chose.<ref name=""labor"">[http://www.nps.gov/timu/historyculture/kp_labor.htm Labor], National Park Service (2006). Retrieved on August 15, 2009.</ref> Kingsley Beatty Gibbs described the task system in his journal: <blockquote>
October 5, 1841—No work was done today, as all the people have it to gather their own crop—It is a rule which we have, to give all the negroes one day in the spring to plant, and one day in the fall to reap, and as there is a rule on Sea Island plantations fixing the tasks required each day to be done, it occurs, during the long days of summer, that the hand is generally done his task by 2 p.m., often sooner, so they have abundance of time to work their own crop, fish, etc., etc.<ref>Fretwell, pp. 23–24.</ref>
</blockquote>

This task system of slavery was common among sea island plantations in the Southeastern United States. In contrast, cotton and tobacco plantations in [[Virginia]] and other parts of the [[South]] practiced the gang system, where an overseer who was also a slave drove slaves to work the entire day.<ref name=""labor""/>

Slaves on Fort George Island were African or first generation African-American. Records and archeological information show they were [[Igbo people|Igbo]] and [[Calabar]]i from [[Nigeria]], and others from the area around what is today [[Guinea]], and a few from [[Zanzibar]].  Archeologist [[Charles H. Fairbanks]] received a Florida Park Service grant to study artifacts found at the slave quarters. His findings, published in 1968, initiated further interest and research in African American archeology in the U.S.<ref>Jackson and Burns, pp. 5–8.</ref> Concentrating on two particular cabins bordering on Palmetto Avenue, Fairbanks found cooking pots used in fireplaces, animal bones—fish, pigs, raccoons, and turtles—discarded as food byproducts, and musket balls and fishing weights.<ref>Jackson and Burns, p. 6.</ref> 

Fairbanks described Kingsley as ""an unusually permissive slave owner""<ref name=""davidson"">Davidson, James, et al. [http://www.diaspora.uiuc.edu/news0906/news0906.html#2 Preliminary Results of the 2006 University of Florida Archaeological Field School Excavations at Kingsley Plantation, Fort George Island, Florida] African Diaspora Archeology Network.

""A Legacy Revealed."" ''Florida''; pp. 12–15.</ref> Historian Daniel Stowell suggests that the cabins and Kingsley's hands-off approach to slave management was intended to prevent the slaves from running away. Kingsley himself wrote about not interfering in his slaves' family lives and ""encouraged as much as possible dancing, merriment and dress, for which Saturday afternoon and night, and Sunday morning were dedicated ... they were perfectly honest and obedient, and appeared quite happy, having no fear but that of offending me; and I hardly ever had occasion to apply other correction than shaming them.""<ref name=""kingsley""/>

Kingsley furthermore trained his slaves for specific tasks, making them skilled artisans and educating them about agriculture and planting. Those who had been educated by Kingsley fetched a much higher price at sale, on average 50 percent higher than market price.<ref name=""may"">May, Philip (January 1945). ""Zephaniah Kingsley, Nonconformist (1765-1843)"", ''The Florida Historical Quarterly'' '''23''' (3), pp. 145–159.</ref><ref group=note>Depending on the condition, training, age, and quality of the slave, a price could range from 50 to 400 [[peso]]s in early 19th century Spanish Florida. Pesos were roughly equivalent to dollars. In 2009 the range would be from ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50|1810|2009|r=0}}}} to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|400|1810|2009|r=0}}}} (Landers, p. 140, 177).</ref> A 2006 excavation sponsored by the [[University of Florida]] uncovered artifacts from the slave cabins, such as the tools the slaves used. In one cabin an intact [[animal sacrifice|sacrificed chicken]] on top of an egg was unearthed, adding evidence to the hypothesis that African slaves kept many of their traditions alive in North America. Archeologists also discovered evidence of an added-on porch to one of the cabins facing away from the main house, an atypical feature for a slave cabin, as owners and overseers constructed quarters to be within their view at all times.<ref name=""davidson""/>

The slave houses were constructed out of [[tabby (cement)|tabby]] and built by the slaves probably in the 1820s or 1830s,<ref>Stowell, p. 72.</ref> although evidence exists that indicates two of them were inhabited by 1814.<ref name=""davidson""/>  Shells left over from [[Timucua]] [[middens]] were burned by the barrelfull in open pits or kilns, then pounded into lime particles, mixed with water, sand, and whole oyster or clam shells, then poured into wooden foundations about {{convert|1|ft|m}} high, and set to dry. The process was repeated and stacked until the desired height of the wall was reached.<ref>Stowell, pp. 71–72.</ref> The floors of the kitchen house and the basement of the owner's house were also constructed of tabby. The material made the houses remarkably durable, resistant to weather and insects, better insulated than wood, and the ingredients were accessible and cheap, although labor-intensive.<ref>Steffen, Colleen (January 6, 2000).""Crumbling past."" ''Florida Times-Union'' (Jacksonville, FL); p. E-1</ref> The slave quarters at Kingsley Plantation are widely considered some of the best surviving examples of the use of this building material.<ref>Stowell, p. 81.</ref> 

Each cabin consisted of a room, fireplace, and sleeping loft. The arrangement of the quarters is distinctive: there were originally 32 cabins laid out in a semicircular arc interrupted by the main thoroughfare to the plantation, Palmetto Avenue.  This formation is unique in plantations in the [[antebellum]] U.S. Historian Daniel Stowell surmises that it may have given slave families a modicum of privacy, although he also suggests overseers and slave managers may have arranged the quarters to be able to watch all the slaves from the owner's house at the same time.<ref>Stowell, p. </ref> Author Daniel Schafer, however, suggests that Anna Jai may have been responsible for this. West African villages were commonly constructed in a circular pattern with the king or ruling family living in the center.<ref>Schafer, p. 55.</ref>

John Rollins deconstructed several of the slave cabins to build a boat house and dock in the 1890s. The archeological significance of the site is considerable in light of the fact that the majority of slave quarters in the Southern United States were not built with quality materials, and most quarters were destroyed after [[abolitionism|emancipation]].<ref>Stowell, pp. 80–81.</ref>

==Kingsley's house and other structures==
[[File:Kingslay main house rear.jpg|thumb|250 px|alt=Color photo of the owner's house from a diagonal view, showing a large white structure with black shutters, two gabled pavilions separated by a porch, a taller larger gable in the center, a small gable roof to the right of the closest pavilion, and a partially obscured pavilion with a gabled roof and chimney. A lawn and bent oak and palm trees surround the house|Rear of the owner's house of the plantation as it faces Fort George Inlet]]
The main residence of the Fort George plantation is a unique two-story house that was probably constructed between 1797 and 1798 by John McQueen, who indicated in a letter at the time that he had built a comfortable house for himself. The house—resembling 17th century British [[gentry]] homes<ref>Stowell, p. 81.</ref>—has a large center room and four [[Pavilion (structure)|one-story pavilions]] at each corner that allowed air to circulate through them to keep them cooler in the summer; each was a bedroom that had a fireplace to heat more efficiently in the winter.<ref>Stowell, p. 67.</ref> The second story of the house has two large rooms.<ref>Stowell, p. A7.</ref> On the roof is a deck and the house faces Fort George Inlet and features two porches on the front and rear of the house. A brick walkway joined the back porch to a wharf on the inlet while Kingsley was in residence.<ref>Schafer (2003), p. 46.</ref> The Florida Division of Historical Resources indicates it may be the oldest plantation house in the state.<ref>[http://www.flheritage.com/facts/reports/places/index.cfm?fuseaction=ListAreas&county=duval Florida's History Through Its Places:Duval County]. Florida Division of Historical Resources (2009). Retrieved on August 14, 2009.</ref>

The main house protected John McQueen's family and neighbors during attacks from invading [[Creek (people)|Creeks]] in 1802; he wrote that at one time 26 people were seeking refuge there. Following raids from Americans during the Patriot Rebellion in 1813, the house was gutted and vandalized. Plantations as far south as [[New Smyrna, Florida|New Smyrna]] were destroyed by rebels fleeing into Georgia. When Kingsley arrived there were no metal fixtures in the doors and the wooden slave quarters had been burned down.<ref>Schafer (1997), p. 27.</ref> John Rollins added sections to the east and west sides of the house in between the pavilions in the 1890s and removed at least three of the fireplace chimneys from the pavilions. One of the clubs that owned the island in the 1920s added electricity.<ref>Stowell, p. A8.</ref>

[[File:Maam Anna House Kingsley Plantation.jpg|thumb|left|200 px|alt=A color photo of a white two-story building with black shutters, a tall wood-shingled roof, and an outdoor veranda.| The first floor has a stucco finish and has one window, the second story is wood clapboard and has two windows topped with a chimney. A lawn and trees surround it.|""Ma'am Anna House"" where Anna Jai lived with her children over the kitchens, front of the owner's house is behind it]]
Next to the main house was a two-story kitchen house that was called ""Ma'am Anna House"" while Anna Jai was on Fort George Island. It was probably built in the 1820s and doubled as a center for food preparation on the ground floor and Anna Jai's residence with her children on the second.<ref>Schafer (2003), p. 48.</ref> Kingsley's nephew and his wife also lived on the grounds and Gibbs probably used a part of the second floor for an office. The main house and Ma'am Anna House were surrounded by a grove of orange, lemon, and banana trees with occasional ornamental [[crepe myrtle]]s. Historian Daniel Schafer posits that Anna Jai would have been familiar with the concepts of polygamy and marrying a slave master to acquire one's freedom.<ref>Schafer (2003), p. 31.</ref> In West Africa, polygamy was not uncommon, and wives often lived in separate quarters from their husbands.<ref>Schafer (2003), pp. 50–51.</ref> Between 1869 and 1877 Rollins built a roof over the walkway between the kitchen house and the main house.<ref>Stowell, p. 68.</ref>

A barn constructed of tabby sits {{convert|150|ft|m}} from the owner's house. Two wells have survived since Kingsley's ownership and two tombs of unknown origin constructed of tabby before Kingsley came to own the island are also located near the plantation. Ruins of another tabby house sits near the entrance of Palmetto Avenue. Its origins are unclear. It has been called the Munsilna McGundo House for Kingsley's fourth wife, as oral history related that it was left to her and her daughter Fatima in Kingsley's will. More recently it has been referred to as Thomson Tabby House named for a planter who died perhaps while constructing it.<ref>Stowell, pp. 75–79.</ref>

==Activities and restoration==
Kingsley Plantation currently showcases the remains of 23 slave houses out of 32 original cabins, located approximately {{convert|1000|ft|m}} south of the main owner's house. One of the slave houses has been restored to appear as it did in the early 19th century; others are in various states of repair or ruin. The kitchen house features a display about slavery on the island, and the barn and garden are also on display. The planter's house is unfurnished and currently closed for structural rehabilitation. Maintenance of the historical structures is the most significant work being done at Kingsley Plantation. The kitchen and owner's house were closed in 2005 due to severe structural damage caused by [[termite]]s and [[humidity]].<ref>Carter, John (March 9, 2005). ""Kingsley Plantation to undergo repairs: Work begun on kitchen, other fixes slated for later."" ''Florida Times-Union'' (Jacksonville); p. K-1.</ref> The kitchen building was restored in 2006, but work is ongoing for the owner's house. Despite the durability of the slave quarters, they are vulnerable to [[vandalism]], and each cabin shows evidence of damage.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/timu/planyourvisit/upload/kp_structural_work.pdf Preservation Work at Kingsley Plantation], National Park Service. Retrieved on August 14, 2009.</ref> While there is no slated completion date for the rehabilitation of the owner's house, one room of the kitchen house is open and contains exhibits. 

Since 1998 Kingsley Plantation has hosted an annual one-day event in October called the Kingsley Heritage Celebration that coincides with the Kingsley family reunion. Several relatives of Kingsley and Anna Jai are notable. Kingsley's youngest sister's daughter, [[Anna McNeill Whistler|Anna McNeill]], participated with her mother in attempting to block Anna Jai from inheriting Kingsley's property. McNeill served as the model for her son, the artist [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|James Whistler]], in his ''[[Arrangement in Grey and Black: The Artist's Mother]]'', popularly known as ''Whistler's Mother''.<ref name=""may""/> Kingsley Beatty Gibbs' brother was George Couper Gibbs, a planter in [[St. Johns County, Florida|St. Johns County]], south of Fort George Island near St. Augustine. Former governor of South Carolina [[Duncan Clinch Heyward]] is descended from him.<ref>Jackson and Burns, pp. 19–20.</ref> 

Kingsley and Anna Jai are the great grandparents of Mary Kingsley Sammis, who married [[Abraham Lincoln Lewis]], one of Florida's first black millionaires and an original investor in the all-black [[American Beach]].<ref>Jackson and Burns, p. 24.</ref> The Kingsley-Sammis-Lewis-Betsch family has been active in Jacksonville's black community for decades. Another branch of Kingsley descendants lives in the [[Dominican Republic]] near where John Maxwell Kingsley lived in Haiti.<ref>Jackson and Burns, p. 23.</ref> [[Spelman College]]'s first black female president, [[Johnnetta B. Cole|Johnnetta Betsch Cole]], is descended from Lewis and Sammis. The Heritage Celebration was moved to [[Black History Month]] in February 2008; Cole was the keynote speaker of the 2009 Kingsley Heritage Celebration. Interpretive events such as music, storytelling, and ranger-led talks about history and archeology regularly occur during the Heritage Celebration.<ref>Lovejoy, Heather (November 7, 2007).

'''[[Puerto Rico]]''' competed in the '''[[2008 Summer Olympics]]''' which was held in [[Beijing]], [[People's Republic of China]] from August 8 to August 24, 2008. The American territory with a population of four million people qualified 22 athletes in eight different sports. The appearance of the Puerto Rican delegation at the Beijing Olympics marked the commonwealth's sixteenth consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics, and its twenty-second appearance at any Olympic games, since its debut at the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] in London, England.  Of its competitors participating in events that involve progression by heats, six athletes advanced at least one round in their events, and two advanced at least two rounds, with [[Asunción Ocasio]] almost medaling bronze in taekwondo. However, there were no Puerto Rican medalists at the Beijing Olympics. [[McWilliams Arroyo]], a boxer, bore Puerto Rico's flag at the ceremonies.

==Background==

[[Puerto Rico]] is a large island on the northern rim of the [[Caribbean Sea]] that is home to approximately 4 million people. It lies due east of the [[Dominican Republic]] on the island [[Hispaniola]], and to the west of the [[United States Virgin Islands]]. Puerto Rico was first colonized by the Spanish, but was ceded to the United States in the wake of the [[Spanish-American War]] in 1898. Puerto Ricans were granted American citizenship in 1917, although it remained apart from the United States and has a constitution that provides for self-government.<ref name=cia /> 41 years after Puerto Ricans became American citizens, Puerto Rico sent its first delegation to the Olympics at the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] in London, England. The American commonwealth has sent a delegation to all sixteen Summer Olympics between then and the 2008 Beijing Olympics in addition to six Winter Olympic games.<ref name=pur-sr />

Between its 1948 debut and its arrival at the Beijing Olympics, Puerto Rican athletes had won six medals (one silver and five bronze). The last medal earned by a Puerto Rican was a bronze medal by [[Daniel Santos (boxer)|Daniel Santos]] at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in Atlanta. No medals were won by Puerto Ricans at Beijing. During the course of the 2008 Olympics, 22 athletes represented Puerto Rico&mdash;17 men and five women&mdash;in eight sports (track and field, boxing, artistic gymnastics, judo, shooting, swimming, taekwondo, and weightlifting). The size of the delegation was 21 athletes smaller than the Puerto Rican delegation that arrived at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in Athens, and 58 athletes smaller than Puerto Rico's largest Olympic team, which included 80 athletes participating in the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in Montréal, Canada.<ref name=pur-sr /> The oldest member of the Beijing delegation was [[Lucas Bennazar]], a sharpshooter, who was 39 years old at the time; boxer [[Jonathan González (welterweight)|Jonathan González]], in contrast, was the youngest at 19 years old.<ref name=pur8-sr /> Boxer [[McWilliams Arroyo]] was the nation's flag bearer at the ceremonies.<ref name=pur-sr />

64,stub,Charlotte Hornets (WFL),project north carolina,"The '''Charlotte Hornets''' were a [[american football|football]] team in the short-lived [[World Football League]]. They were actually relocated to [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] from [[New York City]] in the middle of their inaugural [[1974]] season. 

==In New York==

The Hornets franchise began in [[1973]] in [[Boston]] as the '''Boston Bulldogs'''.  The name was shortened at the 11th hour in October to '''Bulls.'''  They were owned by Howard Baldwin, who was president and minority owner of the [[Hartford Whalers|New England Whalers]] of the [[World Hockey Association]].  Unlike most of the other WFL owners, he didn't have to pay a franchise fee because of his close ties to WFL founder Gary Davidson--who also happened to be commissioner of the WFL.  He also hired [[Babe Parilli]] as head coach.

However, Baldwin was unable to attract more investors.  More seriously, he couldn't find a suitable place to play.  Realizing he had no hope of putting together a viable product in Boston, Baldwin opted to merge with the WFL's as-yet-unnamed New York franchise on [[January 26]] [[1974]].  That team was owned by Whalers majority owner Robert Schmertz, who like Baldwin hadn't had to pay a franchise fee.  The two teams had already worked together very closely in the draft.  The merged team took the name '''New York Stars.'''

Finding a home field for the fledgling team proved just as difficult as finding a name. [[Yankee Stadium]] was closed for renovation right after the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]] finished the 1973 season in October; it would not reopen until 1976. [[Shea Stadium]] became full to capacity as the ""Bronx Bombers"" shared the park with the hometown [[New York Mets|Mets]] and the [[NFL]]'s [[New York Jets|Jets]]. The Stars had to settle for decrepit [[Downing Stadium]], a 22,000-seat facility built during the Depression as a WPA Project, located on [[Randall's Island]] near the [[East River]]. 

Parilli signed a number of former [[Super Bowl III]] Jets including wide receiver George Sauer, who was coming out of retirement after three years, and former All-Pro defensive men Gerry Philbin, as well as John Elliott.

The WFL needed New York in order to have a presence in the largest U.S. media market. The Stars sold between 5,500 and 8,000 season tickets. Its first home game, after losing a close one at [[Jacksonville Sharks|Jacksonville]]-in front of a league high crowd of 59,112 at the [[Gator Bowl Stadium|Gator Bowl]], against the [[Birmingham Americans]] attracted 17,943 New Yorkers. After leading at halftime, 29-3, the Stars were toppled by the efforts of Americans quarterback George Mira, who threw for three touchdowns and ran for another as Birmingham pulled out a 32-29 comeback win. The Stars finally won their first game, as kicker Moses Lajterman put the winning field goal through for a razor-thin 17-15 win over [[Philadelphia Bell|Philadelphia]]. The Stars and hosting Bell performed in front of the largest WFL attended game, with 64,179 on hand. Many of the tickets were sold at large discounts or were given away free in a marketing ploy to make the League appear more successful than it was.

New York then went on a tear, winning five in a row. Among the victims besides the Bell were the [[Jacksonville Sharks]], [[Southern California Sun]], [[Portland Storm]], and [[Houston Texans (WFL)|Houston Texans]]. Coincidentally, the team's winning streak was stopped by those same Texans a week later, with a surprise addition to the Houston roster: [[John Matuszak]].{{Fact|date=September 2008}} Matuszak had been AWOL from the NFL's [[Houston Oilers]] just 48 hours earlier. The Stars had mixed results in the next few weeks, winning over Portland again, but losing to [[Florida Blazers|Florida]] in the rain and [[The Hawaiians]] in the sun. To improve the roster, New York picked up several NFL players from the waiver wire. Among them were cornerback John Dockery, who played for Parilli with the New York Jets, and Don Highsmith, a running back released by Oakland and turned out to be a great addition to the Stars running attack.  The Stars performed better on the field and were a nice alternative than the more expensive, yet losing Giants and Jets. 

For all their on-field success, the Stars were dragged down by serious off-field financial problems.  Like most WFL teams, they were badly undercapitalized.  Their fiscal structure began to founder when Schmertz's construction company ran into trouble.  He was also trapped in a nasty divorce.  

However, even without these factors to consider, the Stars played in a stadium that was completely inadequate for a team aspiring to be part of a major sports organization.  It was nearly inaccessible from most of the city, and had not been well maintained in at least 20 years.  Amenities for fans, players and the press were virtually nonexistent.  The toilets in the locker room frequently overflowed.  During the home opener, the Stars' radio announcers had to sit on orange crates because there were no chairs in the press box; their Birmingham counterparts had to stand.  Parking was inadequate  It soon became obvious that Schmertz and Baldwin wouldn't have enough money to finish the season.  Unable to find a local buyer, the WFL resigned itself to abandoning the nation's biggest market.

[[September 24]], [[1974]] was their final game at New York (the game was moved from Wednesday because of Yom Kippur). Ironically, that same day, the [[Detroit Wheels]]' 33 owners filed for 
bankruptcy. Called the ""Bankrupt Bowl,"" the Stars blew out the destitute Wheels, 37-7.

==In Charlotte==
While they were packing up for the next night's game against the [[Chicago Fire (football)|Chicago Fire]], Parilli announced the team was moving to Charlotte for the rest of the season as the '''Charlotte Stars'''. The league had found a buyer in former [[New England Patriots]] executive [[Upton Bell]] after Charlotte mayor [[John M. Belk]] helped engineer a deal that made the move feasible. Forced to find a new logo literally at the last minute, the equipment man simply stuck the [[Chicago Bears]]' ""C"" logo over the old New York logo. The Stars routed the Fire, 41-30.  A few days later, they were renamed the Hornets. Shortly after they arrived in Charlotte, however, they had their uniforms impounded due to an unpaid laundry bill from their New York days.

The team's first home game at Charlotte was a rousing success. In the league's brief history, the Hornets sold out all 25,133 tickets, leaving some 5,000 out of luck. Unfortunately, the visiting [[Memphis Southmen]] ruined their debut, winning 27-23. In spite of the loss, the new Charlotte club - which played at [[American Legion Memorial Stadium]]-did far better in tickets sales than as the old New York Stars. In four games at Charlotte, the Hornets sold over 80,000 compared to just 75,000 in seven games at Downing Stadium. Toward the end of the season, the Hornets struggled on the field, losing their last four games. Although Charlotte finished second place with a 10-10 record, they couldn't afford to attend the playoff game at [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], against the first place Eastern Division winning [[Florida Blazers]]. The [[Philadelphia Bell]], who finished third with a 9-11 record, took the Hornets' place.

The team returned for the abbreviated [[1975 in sports|1975]] campaign and lasted until the league ceased operations in midseason. The Hornets finished at 6-5.

""'''Pilot'''"" is the two-part [[television pilot]] of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', with part 1 premiering on September 22, 2004 and part 2 one week later on September 29. Both parts were  directed by [[J.J. Abrams]], who co-wrote the script with [[Damon Lindelof]]. [[Jeffrey Lieber]], who had been commissioned by ABC to write the first version of the script, earned a story credit. Filmed in [[Oahu, Hawaii]], it was the most expensive pilot episode up to that time, costing between $10 and $14 million,  largely due to the expense of purchasing, shipping, and dressing a decommissioned [[Lockheed 1011]] to represent Flight 815's  wreckage. Many changes were made during the casting process, including the selected actors, the characters' behaviors and fates.  

The pilot introduces the survivors of [[Oceanic Flight 815]], who experience a plane crash and end up on a mysterious island. Three of the characters, [[Jack Shephard]] ([[Matthew Fox (actor)|Matthew Fox]]), [[Kate Austen]] ([[Evangeline Lilly]]) and [[Charlie Pace]] ([[Dominic Monaghan]]), are featured before the crash in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s of their experiences on the plane as it breaks apart in mid-air; these scenes set a precedence for ''Lost''{{'s}} defining use of flashbacks. The ''Lost'' pilot is one of the most critically acclaimed television pilots of all time. Both parts earned high ratings, with Part 1 breaking the record for a pilot episode with 18.6 million viewers, and the episode would later win many awards and accolades.

==Plot==
===Part 1===
On September 22, 2004, [[Jack Shephard]] ([[Matthew Fox (actor)|Matthew Fox]]) awakens disoriented in the jungle and notices a [[Characters of Lost#Vincent|yellow Labrador retriever]] ([[Madison (dog)|Madison]]) darting through the bamboo forest. Following the path it came from, Jack runs haphazardly through the jungle to a beach, where he is confronted by the carnage of the airplane crash of [[Oceanic Flight 815]]. Jack, a surgeon, administers medical aid to the survivors, assisting the pregnant [[Claire Littleton]] ([[Emilie de Ravin]]), enlisting [[Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes|Hurley]] ([[Jorge Garcia]]) to watch her, and administering [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] to [[Rose Henderson]] ([[L. Scott Caldwell]]), saving her life. After the initial shock passes, Jack retreats to a quiet area beyond the beach to tend to his own injuries, when he notices [[Kate Austen]] ([[Evangeline Lilly]]) passing through the jungle. He asks her for assistance, which she gives by helping [[surgical suture|suture]] a wound on his back. [[Sayid Jarrah]] ([[Naveen Andrews]]) organizes a clean-up crew, while Hurley salvages meals from the plane's [[galley (kitchen)|galley]] and distributes them to the survivors. [[Shannon Rutherford]] ([[Maggie Grace]]) refuses chocolate offered by her brother [[Boone Carlyle]] ([[Ian Somerhalder]]), believing that rescue is imminent. A Korean man, [[Jin-Soo Kwon]] ([[Daniel Dae Kim]]), tells his wife, [[Sun-Hwa Kwon]] ([[Yunjin Kim]]), in Korean that she should remain close to him at all times.

That night, as Jack and Kate decide to search for the plane cockpit as its [[transceiver]] would allow the survivors to send a distress signal, loud roaring noises and crashing trees are heard in the nearby jungle. The following morning, the two are accompanied by [[Charlie Pace]] ([[Dominic Monaghan]]) on their way into the jungle. The cockpit is found leaning against a tree, forcing the trio to climb it to reach the cabin. Charlie disappears into the [[Aircraft lavatory|bathroom]] while Jack and Kate awaken the [[concussion|concussed]] pilot ([[Greg Grunberg]]) in the cabin. The pilot tells them that the plane had lost radio contact six hours after take off, where it turned back for [[Fiji]] and hit [[wake turbulence]]. After estimating that the flight was 1,000 miles off course before it crashed, the pilot tries using the transceiver, but cannot get a signal. Suddenly the strange roaring noises heard on the beach the previous night return, and when the pilot investigates, he is seized by something outside and blood splatters on the window, prompting the trio to grab the transceiver and flee. During the escape, Charlie falls and Jack returns to help him, while a terrified Kate runs on. After the monster disappears, Kate, Charlie and Jack reunite and find the pilot's bloodied corpse suspended in a treetop.

====Flashbacks====
On the airplane, Jack jokingly tells a flight attendant named Cindy ([[Kimberley Joseph]]) that his alcoholic drink is not strong, and she gives him a stronger one. Charlie runs by while being called after by flight attendants before turbulence shakes the plane, scaring Rose, who is sitting across from Jack. The two talk, and Rose mentions that her husband is in the bathroom. The plane gets exceptionally shaky, causing a man to hit the plane's ceiling and oxygen masks to fall.

===Part 2===
Jack, Kate, and Charlie head back to the beach, where ten-year-old [[Walt Lloyd]] ([[Malcolm David Kelley]]) discovers a pair of handcuffs, which he shows to his father, [[Michael Dawson (Lost)|Michael Dawson]] ([[Harold Perrineau]]). Afterwards, [[James ""Sawyer"" Ford]] ([[Josh Holloway]]) attacks Sayid, claiming he is a terrorist who blew up the plane, but they are soon stopped by Jack and Michael. Sayid repairs the transceiver, but it has little battery life and does not have a signal. He  explains to Kate that by heading up the mountains to higher ground, they might be able to acquire a signal. They decide to go inland, and Charlie, Sawyer, Shannon and Boone soon follow them. Along the way, they are attacked by a charging [[polar bear]], which Sawyer shoots and kills. When asked about where he found the gun, Sawyer says he took it from a dead [[U.S. Marshal]]. Sayid accuses Sawyer of being the marshal's prisoner. Kate takes the gun from Sawyer and Sayid instructs her on how to dismantle it.

Back at the beach, the marshal ([[Fredric Lane]]) wakes up as Jack is suturing him, and asks Jack, ""Where is she?"" Inland, Sayid turns on the transceiver and it has a signal. However, it is being blocked by a looping transmission in French, which Shannon translates as ""I'm alone now, on the island alone. Please someone come. The others are dead. It killed them. It killed them all."" Sayid calculates that has been repeating for over sixteen years before Charlie says, ""Guys, where are we?""

====Flashbacks====
An anxious Charlie runs to the bathroom, where he locks himself to snort [[heroin]]. After the plane becomes shaky, Charlie is slammed against the bathroom ceiling, and decides to leave. After being nearly hit by a refreshment cart, Charlie rushes to a seat several rows back and straps himself in as the plane shakes.

Kate is revealed to be the marshal's prisoner, wearing the handcuffs that Walt found in the jungle. As the turbulence hits, the marshal is knocked unconscious by a falling suitcase. Kate struggles to put on her oxygen mask due to the handcuffs, so she uncuffs herself using the marshal's keys and puts the marshal's oxygen mask on him before attaching her own, at which point the tail end of the plane suddenly breaks off and flies away.

The series began [[Filmmaking#Development|development]] in the summer of 2003, when ABC senior vice president Thom Sherman  decided to order from [[Spelling Television]] a script based on an idea of network president [[Lloyd Braun]], who envisioned a series that was a cross between the novel ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'', the movie ''[[Cast Away]]'', the television series ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', and the popular reality show ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2013/04/08/56472.htm | title='Lost' Royalties Demand Had Smoke but no Fire | publisher=Courthouse News Service | date=8 April 2013 | accessdate=27 February 2014 | author=Dotinga, William}}</ref> Writer Jeffrey Lieber was contacted by Spelling's vice president of series development Ted Gold, and in September 2003 [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] to ABC the concepts for ''Nowhere''. Sherman approved the idea and hired Lieber to write a script, but Braun wound up rejecting Lieber's draft and subsequent rewrites.<ref name=lieber>{{cite news|title=Cast Away| last=Bernstein|first=David|url=http://chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/August-2007/Cast-Away/index.php?cp=2&si=1#artanc| publisher=[[Chicago (magazine)|''Chicago'' magazine]]|date=August 2007}}</ref> Thus in January 2004 Braun contacted [[J. J. Abrams]], who developed the TV series ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'' for ABC, to write a new pilot script.  Although initially hesitant, Abrams warmed up to the idea on the condition that the series would have a supernatural angle to it and he was assigned a writing partner. <ref name=""DT081405"">{{cite news| last=Craig| first=Olga| title=The man who discovered ''Lost''&nbsp;— and found himself out of a job| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1496199/The-man-who-discovered-Lost---and-found-himself-out-of-a-job.html| publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|date=August 14, 2005| location=London}}</ref><ref name=""EW"">{{Cite journal|date=May 14, 2010|title=Lost: How It Began|journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|issue=1102|editor1-first=Jess|editor1-last=Cagle|issn=1049-0434|oclc=137343926|accessdate=December 12, 2011|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20367067,00.html}}</ref> ABC executive Heather Kadin sent him [[Damon Lindelof]], who had long intended to meet Abrams as he wished to write for ''Alias''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/tv/article/damon-lindelofs-history-lost-show-he-longed-quit-31281|title=Damon Lindelof’s History of ‘Lost’ (A Show He Longed to Quit)|publisher=[[The Wrap]]|first=Tim|last=Molloy|date=September 23, 2011 |accessdate=March 4, 2014}}</ref> Together, Abrams and Lindelof developed the characters and plot of ''Lost'', along with creating a series ""[[Bible (writing)|bible]]"" which would store the major [[Mythology|mythological]] ideas and plot points for an ideal five to six season run for the show.<ref>{{cite news| last=Jensen| first=Jeff| title=When Stephen King met the ''Lost'' boys...| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1562722,00.html| publisher=EW.com|accessdate=2007-11-24| date=November 24, 2006}}</ref><ref>Burk, Bryan, ''Lost Season 1 DVD'' (extras), [[Buena Vista Home Entertainment]], September 6, 2005.</ref> The development of the show was constrained by tight deadlines, as it had been commissioned late in the 2004 season's development cycle.

Though Abrams and Lindelof did not use Lieber's work as inspiration for their own, Lieber's request for [[WGA screenwriting credit system|arbitration]] at the [[Writers Guild of America, East|Writer's Guild of America]] pointing out the similarities in both scripts earned him a story credit. Lieber would later say the series would drift much from his concepts in ''Nowhere'', declaring ''Lost'' was ""more like ''[[The Lord of the Rings|Lord of the Rings]]'' than ''[[Lord of the Flies]]''"".<ref name=lieber/>

===Casting===

In the initial plans for the series, Jack was going to die midway through the first episode. The role of Jack was originally offered to [[Michael Keaton]], but when the producers quickly changed their minds about Jack's death, making him the leader, Keaton gave up the job. After [[Matthew Fox (actor)|Matthew Fox]]'s casting as Jack, the character was established as a leader, and the airplane pilot was introduced to take Jack's place as The Monster's first victim.<ref name=""Before They Were Lost""/> The pilot wound up being played by [[Greg Grunberg]], a childhood friend of Abrams who the producer brings into most of his projects.<ref>{{cite video|title=[[Audio commentary]] for Pilot, Parts 1 and 2|people=Abrams, J.J., Lindelof, Damon and Burk, Bryan|location=''Lost: The Complete First Season'' DVD|publisher=Buena Vista Home Entertainment}}</ref> Around seventy-five women of different shapes, sizes, ethnicities and ages auditioned to be Kate. In the initial plans, Kate would emerge as the leader after Jack died. She was not going to be a fugitive, instead her husband was going to go to the bathroom shortly before the plane split in mid air, and she would remain adamant on the Island that he was alive. This ended up being used for Rose’s ([[L. Scott Caldwell]]) character instead. The producers were impressed with Canadian Evangeline Lilly's audition for Kate, as she displayed the confidence with vulnerability that they were looking for. As this was Lilly's first role, she had difficulty obtaining a [[Visa (document)|visa]] to work in America. She was supposed to start on the first day of filming, but the schedule was rearranged to give her more time, and in the meantime, the producers began auditioning again in case the visa did not come through. However during one of the auditions, they got an email confirming that she had obtained her visa and could start work on the show.<ref name=""Before They Were Lost""/>

Matthew Fox, Dominic Monaghan and Jorge Garcia originally auditioned for the role of Sawyer, who at the time was supposed to be a suit-wearing city con man, but the role was given to [[Josh Holloway]]. Garcia was the first actor the producers knew they were going to cast. While the producers thought Garcia was spectacular, they did not think he fit in the role of Sawyer, so they created the Hurley character for him instead.<ref name=""Before They Were Lost""/> When Holloway auditioned for Sawyer, the producers liked his southern accent and the edge he brought to the character (Holloway reportedly forgot his lines and kicked a chair in frustration). The producers knew he did not suit the role, but thought he was very watchable, so they rewrote the role to suit him, making him more feral, Southern, but kept the same intelligence he originally had.<ref name=""Before They Were Lost"">{{cite video | title = Before They Were Lost | medium = Documentary | location = ''[[Lost (season 1)|Lost: The Complete First Season]]'' | publisher = [[Buena Vista Distribution|Buena Vista Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> After appearing in ''[[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|The Lord of the Rings]]'', Dominic Monaghan was offered many fantasy-based roles, like elves and pixies. He was keen to portray a different role, so he wanted a contemporary part that had layers and an edge. Originally Charlie was an older rocker that has been a big hit in the 1980s but now had a heroin addiction. After the producers enjoyed Monaghan’s audition of Sawyer, they decided to cast him as Charlie and rewrote the script to make Charlie a young has-been instead.<ref name=""Before They Were Lost""/> 

[[Image:Harold Perrineau, Jr.jpg|alt=A picture of [[Harold Perineau]], who plays Michael Dawson, a father.|thumb|left|200px|Harold Perrineau plays Michael Dawson, a father.]]
When the producers were auditioning actors for roles in ''Lost'', Harold Perrineau was in the area.<ref name=""Before They Were Lost""/> The producers called it a ""natural move"" to have him audition.<ref name=""Before They Were Lost""/> Although initially skeptical about the show, he took the role when ''Lost'' creator [[J. J. Abrams]] explained more about it.<ref name=""Before They Were Lost""/> A lot of children were seen for the role of Walt. They were narrowed down to the top three, with Malcolm David Kelley winning it, after the producers were impressed with his role in ''[[Antwone Fisher (film)|Antwone Fisher]]''.<ref name=""Before They Were Lost"">""Before They Were Lost"".  ''[[Lost (season 1)#DVD release|Lost: The Complete First Season]]'', [[Buena Vista Home Entertainment]].  September 6, 2005.  [[Featurette]], disc 7.</ref>  Abrams had worked with Terry O'Quinn previously on ''[[Alias (TV Series)|Alias]]'', and was keen to work with him again. He explained to O'Quinn that although the role in the first episodes would be fairly small, the character will develop afterwards. O'Quinn took the role as he trusted Abrams. He was also the only character who did not have to officially audition for a part of a main character.<ref name=""Before They Were Lost""/> The producers were looking for someone who had a ""[[Paris Hilton]] quality"" to play Shannon, but she could not just be shallow, as the storyline would require more than that.  A lot of women were auditioned before the producers finally settled on Maggie Grace.<ref name=""Before They Were Lost""/> She was written to be an [[antipathetic]] character in the first season as the producers needed a character they could use to create opposition and conflict.<ref name=""PodcastNov05"">[[Damon Lindelof|Lindelof, Damon]] & [[Carlton Cuse|Cuse, Carlton]], (November 14, 2005) ""Official ''Lost'' Audio Podcast November 14, 2005,"" [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].</ref> Unlike many other characters of the first season, who were rewritten based on their actors, Boone was largely the same through production. He was originally going to be named Boone Anthony Markham V, going by the nickname, ""Five"". Ian Somerhalder was cast in the role, but he did not want to shoot a pilot; however, he jumped at the opportunity once he found out he would be working with Abrams.<ref name=""Before They Were Lost""/>

''Lost'' was planned to be a multi-cultural show with an international cast. The producers thought it was essential that an Australian was cast for the part of Claire, and the Oceanic 815 was leaving from Sydney. Emilie de Ravin was working in Edmonton, so was unable to go to the auditions, which were being held in [[Los Angeles]]. From a video she sent to the producers, they were able to tell that de Ravin had the youth and sweetness required for the role, but also looked as though she had some life experience.<ref name=""Before They Were Lost""/> Sayid was not in the original draft of the pilot episode, but executive consultant Jeff Pinkner had worked with Naveen Andrews on a short-lived ABC series called ''The Beast'', and was keen to have him on ''Lost''. The producers were surprised that Andrews was interested in the role. When they cast him, all Andrews was told was that Sayid was from Iraq and had been in the army.<ref name=""Before They Were Lost""/> [[Yunjin Kim]] originally auditioned for Kate. At her audition she told the producers that she spoke fluent [[Korean language|Korean]], having been raised in [[South Korea]], where she had starred in several films. The producers were impressed with Kim's performance and wrote her the character of Sun, who was planned to be someone who could not speak English, but after examining her relationship with her husband, the audience would learn that she does in fact speak it. [[Daniel Dae Kim]] was cast in the role of Jin, Sun's husband. Dae Kim described his audition as a ""really interesting experience"". He found it especially hard as it was his first time acting in Korean, and he had not spoken in it regularly since being in high school, when he would talk to his parents.<ref name=""Before They Were Lost""/>

'''Diaspora Yeshiva Band''' ({{lang-he|להקת ישיבת התפוצות}}) was an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] band founded at the Diaspora Yeshiva on [[Mount Zion]], [[Jerusalem]], by ''[[baal teshuva]]'' students from the United States. In existence from 1975 to 1983, the band infused [[Rock music|rock]] and [[bluegrass]] with Jewish lyrics, creating a style of music it called ""Hasidic rock""{{sfn|Tilbury|1989|p=193}} or ""Country and Eastern"".<ref name=bio>{{cite web |url= http://www.diasporaband.com/biography/|title=Biography|publisher=Diaspora Yeshiva Band|year=2014|accessdate=16 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=forward>{{cite web |url= http://forward.com/articles/13320/a-jewish-pop-band-worth-the-wait-/|title=A Jewish Pop Band Worth the Wait|first=Alexander|last=Gelfand|date=8 May 2008|accessdate=16 November 2014|work=[[The Forward]]}}</ref> The band was very popular on college campuses in the early to mid-1980s, and was famous in Jerusalem for its Saturday-night concerts at [[David's Tomb]]. It had a considerable influence on [[contemporary Jewish religious music]], inspiring later bands such as [[Blue Fringe]], Even Sh'siyah, Piamenta, [[Reva l'sheva]], [[Soulfarm]], the [[Moshav (band)|Moshav Band]], and [[Shlock Rock]]. Fifteen years after it disbanded, band leader Avraham Rosenblum revamped the band under the name ""Avraham Rosenblum & Diaspora"" and produced several more albums.

==Background==
The Diaspora Yeshiva was founded in 1967 by Rabbi Mordechai Goldstein, an alumnus of the Chofetz Chaim Yeshiva in [[Queens]], New York, and a colleague of Rabbi [[Shlomo Carlebach (musician)|Shlomo Carlebach]].{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=330}} The Diaspora Yeshiva was the first [[Orthodox Jewish outreach|outreach]] yeshiva for [[Baal teshuva movement|''baalei teshuva'']].{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=330}}{{sfn|Kaplan|2013|p=291}} Unlike traditional rabbinic academies, the yeshiva reached out to young Jewish men who had never been exposed to traditional [[Torah study|Torah]] or [[Talmud]] study. It offered introductory and intermediate courses together with acclimation to an Orthodox Jewish lifestyle.{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=330}} To appeal to students who identified with the [[hippie]] [[subculture]] prevalent on college campuses in those years, the yeshiva adopted a [[Neo-Hasidism|neo-Hasidic]] approach. Students were encouraged to keep their long hair and their musical instruments.{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=331}} 

Numerous students were professional or semi-professional musicians, and several musical collaborations were spawned in the yeshiva dorms.<ref name=mish/> In 1975 student Avraham Rosenblum, a rock guitarist who had started his own band in New York in 1970, founded the Diaspora Yeshiva Band.<ref name=mish/>{{sfn|Strom|2011|p=196}} The band became an outreach tool for other hippie students and, later, post-hippie seekers, using [[Jewish music]] to draw them into the milieu of [[Torah study]].{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=331}}<ref name=mish/>

==History==
The Diaspora Yeshiva Band staged its first concert at the Beit Ha'am hall in the [[Nachlaot]] neighborhood of Jerusalem during [[Hanukkah]] 1975.<ref name=mish/> After that, the band became well-known for its weekly Saturday-night concerts held in a room adjacent to [[David's Tomb]] (located in the same courtyard as the yeshiva) on Mount Zion.<ref name=mish/>{{sfn|Selavan|1993|p=88}}{{sfn|Sofer|1995|p=92}} These concerts attracted American, British and French secular youth; yeshiva and seminary students; and Israeli soldiers.<ref name=mish/> Band members continued to perform with the group even after they had married and begun studying in [[kollel]].<ref name=mish/>

''' Fritzi Scheff''' (August 30, 1879 – April 8, 1954) was an [[United States|American]] actress and vocalist.

==Biography==
Born '''Friederike Scheff'''  in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] to Dr. Gottfried Scheff and Anna Yeager, she studied at the [[Hoch Conservatory]] in [[Frankfurt]] and made her début in [[Munich]] in the title röle of ''Martha'' (1898).  In 1901 she first appeared at the [[Metropolitan Opera|Metropolitan Opera House]], [[New York City|New York]], singing rôles in ''[[La Bohème]]'', ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg|Die Meistersinger]]'', ''[[Die Walküre]]'', and ''[[Don Giovanni]]''.  She sang in the [[Victor Herbert]] operetta ''[[Babette (operetta)|Babette]]'' at [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and New York (1903). Toward the end of the following year's season Schiff became ill and was replaced by her [[understudy]] [[Ida Hawley]] to close out the remaining performances of Babette.<ref>Daily Gazette And Bulletin - May 23, 1904, Williamsport, Pennsylvania</ref> Schiff had immense success as Fifi in ''[[Mlle. Modiste]]'' (1905–1908) and 1913) and appeared also in ''[[The Prima Donna]]'' (1908), ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1910), ''[[The Duchess (opera)|The Duchess]]'' (1911), and ''[[The Love Wager]]'' (1912).  From 1913 to 1918, she appeared principally in [[vaudeville]], returning in the latter year to the musical opera stage in ''Glorianna''.<ref>{{Cite Collier's|Scheff, Fritzi}}</ref>

==Movies and television==
In 1915 Scheff appeared in her first film, ''Pretty Mrs. Smith'', based on a Broadway play she starred in. It was produced and directed by [[Hobart Bosworth]]. She made no other silent pictures. In the late 40s and early 50s Scheff ventured into sound movies and television. She appeared in night clubs and on talk shows such as Ralph Edwards ''This is Your Life'' shortly before her death.

==Marriages==
She married, first, Baron Fritz von Bardeleben a Prussian nobleman, then in 1908 [[John Fox, Jr.]] author of ''[[The Trail of the Lonesome Pine (novel)|The Trail of the Lonesome Pine]]'', and, in 1913, George Anderson, an actor.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AL9QAAAAIBAJ&sjid=niMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7263,4445749&dq=fritzi-scheff&hl=en|title=Saucy Kiss Me Again Girl Singer Fritzi Scheff Is Dead|date=April 9, 1954|work=[[The Milwaukee Journal]]|accessdate=17 June 2011}}</ref> She bore no children in any of the marriages.

'''Arthur Henry Sarsfield Ward''' (15 February 1883 – 1 June 1959), better known as '''Sax Rohmer''', was a prolific English novelist. He is best remembered for his series of novels featuring the master criminal Dr. [[Fu Manchu]].<ref name=""ja"">""Rohmer, Sax"" by Jack Adrian in [[David Pringle]], ''St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost & Gothic Writers''. London : St. James Press, 1998, ISBN 1558622063 (pp. 482–4).</ref>

== Life and work ==
Born in [[Birmingham]] to a [[working class|working-class]] Irish Catholic family, he had an entirely [[working class education]] and early career before beginning to write. Rohmer initially pursued a career as a civil servant before concentrating on writing full-time.

He worked as a poet, songwriter, and comedy sketch writer in [[Music Hall]] before creating the Sax Rohmer persona and pursuing a career writing weird fiction.

Like his contemporaries [[Algernon Blackwood]] and [[Arthur Machen]], Rohmer claimed membership to one of the factions of the [[qabbalistic]] [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]].<ref>http://www.shadowplayzine.com/Articles/hermetic_horrors.htm</ref> Rohmer also claimed ties to the [[Rosicrucians]], but the validity of his claims has been questioned. His physician and family friend, Dr. R. Watson Councell may have been his only legitimate connection to such organisations. It is believed that Rohmer may have exaggerated his association to boost his literary reputation as an occult writer.

His first published work came in 1903, when the short story ""The Mysterious Mummy"" was sold to ''Pearson's Weekly''. Rohmer's main literary influences
seem to have been [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] and [[M. P. Shiel]]. 
<ref name=""ja"" />

He gradually transitioned from writing for [[Music Hall]] performers to concentrating on short stories and serials for magazine publication. In 1909 he married Rose Elizabeth Knox.

He published his first novel ''Pause!'' anonymously in 1910.

==The Fu Manchu series==
After penning ''Little Tich'' in 1911 (as ghostwriter for the famous music hall entertainer of the same name: [[Little Tich]]) he issued the first Fu Manchu novel, ''[[The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu]]'', also serialised from October 1912 – June 1913. It was an immediate success, with its fast-paced story of [[Denis Nayland Smith]] and Dr. Petrie facing the worldwide conspiracy of the '[[Yellow Peril]]'. The Fu Manchu stories, together with his more conventional detective series characters—Paul Harley, Gaston Max, Red Kerry, Morris Klaw (an [[occult detective]]), and The Crime Magnet— made Rohmer one of the most successful and well-paid authors of the 1920s and 1930s. The first three Fu Manchu books were published in the four years 1913–17; but it was not until 1931 (some fourteen years after the third book in the series) that Rohmer returned to the series with ''The Daughter of Fu Manchu''. The reason for the long interval was that Rohmer wanted to be well and truly done with the series after ''The Si-Fan Mysteries'', much as [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] did with [[Sherlock Holmes]]. The first three books had been successfully filmed by Stoll in the twenties as a pair of serials. In 1928, Rohmer bowed to pressure and agreed to write a fourth novel as a serial for ''Collier's''. Paramount had the first [[Warner Oland]] picture gearing up for production and the daily newspaper strip based on the series was in the offing. There was public demand for the character's return.

Rohmer's first effort at reviving the Fu Manchu property was eventually reworked as ''The Emporer of America''. The original intent had been for the head of the organisation to be Fu Manchu's daughter. He kept Head Centre as a female criminal mastermind to combat Drake Roscoe, but was very unhappy with the book both as it started and in its finished form. He would later return to Drake Roscoe and his female supervillain for the Sumuru series. In the meantime, he tried again to focus his energies on what was first titled ''Fu Manchu's Daughter'' for ''Collier's'' in 1930, but with an older (now knighted) Nayland Smith as the protagonist once more. The results were infinitely better and jump-started the series in the process. 

In the 28 years from 1931 to 1959, Rohmer added no fewer than 10 new books to the Fu Manchu series, meaning the series totals thirteen books in all (not counting the posthumous collection ''The Wrath of Fu Manchu'').

The Fu Manchu series drew much criticism from the Chinese government and Chinese
communities in the US for what was seeing as negative ethnic stereotyping.Sociologist
Virginia Berridge notes Rohmer created a false image of London's 
[[British Chinese|Chinese community]] as crime-ridden,
noting the [[Limehouse]] Chinese were one of the most law-abiding of London's 
ethnic minorities.<ref name=""ja""/>    
Critic [[Jack Adrian]] notes that ""Rohmer's own [[racism]] was careless and casual, a mere
symptom of his times"".<ref name=""ja""/>

==Other work==

Rohmer made friends with escape artist [[Harry Houdini]], who wrote to him in praise of Rohmer's ''The Romance of Sorcery''. Rohmer based his mystery-solving magician character Bazarada on Houdini.

''The Orchard of Tears'' is an odd book in the context of Sax Rohmer's other work. There are no oriental villains or exotic locations; rather, there are gentle rabbits and lambs in pastoral settings and a great deal of philosophical musing. As much as he enjoyed Fu Manchu—and the notoriety and income the character provided—Rohmer had other interests and a markedly serious side. The departure from his expected subject matter is plainly signalled by the book's dedication: 'To the slaves of the pomegranate, sons of Adam and daughters of Eve, who drink at the fountain of life, this chalice is offered as a loving-cup'. ''The Orchard of Tears'' is Rohmer's most restrained and serious novel. 

In ''The Quest of the Sacred Slipper'' (1919) terror comes to Britain when a self-centered archaeologist unearths one of [[Islam]]'s holiest [[relic]]s—the sacred slipper of the [[prophet Mohammed]]. Until it is returned to its rightful people, the implacable Hassan of [[Aleppo]] vows his reign of death and destruction shall not cease. Behind these inhuman outrages is a secret group of fanatics. Not even the best men of [[Scotland Yard]] seem able to apprehend them. For, in some mystical way, this phantom band had never been seen or even heard.

''Tales of Chinatown'' (1922) is a collection of ten stories published in hardcover by Cassell in 1922 and Doubleday, Page and Company in 1922. All the stories first appeared in magazine format. This collection includes a story considered one of his best and also anthologised many times; ""Tcheriapin."" The story ""The Hand of the Mandarin Quong"" was rewritten for this; first published as ""Hand of the White Sheikh"" Rohmer changed the setting to a Chinatown background and published it as ""The Mystery of the Shriveled Hand,"" the title then changed for this collection.

Rohmer also wrote several novels of [[Horror film|supernatural horror]], including ''Brood of the Witch-Queen'', described by Adrian as ""Rohmer's masterpiece"".
<ref name=""ja"" /><ref>L.D. Allen, ""Sax Rohmer"",in [[E. F. Bleiler]], ed. ''Supernatural Fiction Writers''. New York: Scribner's, 1985. pp.555–560.</ref> Rohmer was very poor at managing his wealth, however, and made several disastrous business decisions that hampered him throughout his career. His final success came with a series of novels featuring a female variation on Fu Manchu, [[Sumuru (literary character)|Sumuru]]. The Sumuru series consist of five books. Rohmer also wrote numerous short stories; ""The Master of Hollow Grange"" (1920),
is a homage to [[M. R. James]]' story ""Lost Hearts"", featuring a [[mad scientist]] who
preys on children.<ref name=""ja"" />
 
After [[World War II]], the Rohmers moved to New York, only returning to London shortly before his death. Rohmer died in 1959 due to an outbreak of [[Influenza A virus subtype H2N2|influenza (""Asian Flu"")]]. 

His wife published her own mystery novel, ''Bianca in Black'', in 1958 under the [[pen name]] Elizabeth Sax Rohmer. Some editions of the book mistakenly credit her as Rohmer's daughter. 

Elizabeth Sax Rohmer (1886&ndash;1979) and [[Cay Van Ash]] (1918&ndash;1994), her husband's former assistant, wrote a [[biography]] of the author, ''Master of Villainy'', published in 1972.

The '''Central American Squirrel Monkey''' (''Saimiri oerstedii'') is a [[squirrel monkey]] [[species]] from [[Central America]]. It is found in [[Costa Rica]] and [[Panama]] on the [[Pacific]] coast. Even within Costa Rica and Panama the Central American Squirrel Monkey's range is highly restricted.  Within Panama its range is limited to the Western Pacific tip near the Costa Rica border, and within Costa Rica its range is limited to the Central and Southern Pacific coast, primarily in [[Manuel Antonio National Park|Maunuel Antonio]] and [[Corcovado National Park|Corcovado]] [[National Parks]].  

It is a small monkey with an orange back and a distinctive white and black facial mask.  It lives in large groups that typically contain between 20 and 75 monkeys.  It has one of the most egalitarian social structures of all monkeys.  Females do not form dominance hierarchies, and males only form dominance hierachies at breeding season.  But even during breeding season, males do not fight over females and do not attempt to force females to copulate with them.  It has an omnivorous diet, eating fruits, other plant materials, [[invertebrate]]s (especially [[grasshopper]]s and [[caterpillar]]s) and some small [[vertebrate]]s.  It turn, it has a number of predators, including [[bird of prey|raptors]], [[Felidae|cats]] and smakes.

Reproduction is seasonal, with all births occurring within a short period of time in February and March.  Females become sexually mature at 2 1/2 years, and males become sexually mature at 4 to 5 years.  Sexually mature females leave the natal group, but males can remain with their natal group their entire life.  The Central American Squirrel Monkey can live for more than 15 years.

==Description==

The Central American Squirrel Monkey differs in coloration from squirrel monkeys from [[South America]]. While South American squirrel monkeys tend to be primarily greenish in color, the Central American Squirrel Monkey has a orange back with olive shoulders, hips and tail and white undersides. The hands and feet are also orange.  There is a black cap at the top of the head, and a black tip at the end of the tail.  Males generally have lighter caps than females.  The face is white with black rims around the eyes and black around the nose and mouth.<ref name=pic>{{cite book|title=The Pictorial Guide to the Living Primates|author=Rowe, N.|page=98|year=1996|isbn=0-9648825-0-7}}</ref><ref name=field>{{cite book|title=Neotropical Rainforest Mammals A Field Guide|edition=Second Edition|author=Emmons, L.|page=126–127|year=1997|isbn=0-226-20721-8}}</ref>
[[Image:Central American Squirrel Monkey 2.jpeg|thumb|left|Full body coloration]]

There are two subspecies which are similar in coloration, but differ in the shade of the cap.  The northern subspecies, living in Central Pacific Costa Rica, has a lighter cap than the southern subspecies, which lives in Panama and in parts of Costa Rica near Panama.<ref name=field/>

Adults reach a length of between {{convert|266|and|291|mm|in|lk=on}}, excluding tail, and a weight between {{convert|600|and|950|g|oz|lk=on}}.<ref name=field/><ref name=perspective>{{cite book|title=Primates in Perspective|chapter=The Cebines|author=Jack, K.|editor = Campbell, C., Fuentes, A., MacKinnon, K., Panger, M., & Bearder, S.|year=2007|page=107–120|isbn=978-0-19-517133-4}}</ref>  The tail is longer than the body, and between {{convert|362|and|389|mm|in|lk=on|abbr=on}} in length.<ref name=field/>  As with other squirrel monkeys, there is considerable [[sexual dimorphism]].  On average, males weigh 16% more than females.<ref name=perspective/>  Males have an average body weight of {{convert|829|g|oz|lk=on|abbr=on}} and females have an average body weight of {{convert|695|g|oz|lk=on|abbr=on}}.<ref name=perspective/>

Squirrel monkeys have the largest brains of all [[primates]] relative to their body size.<ref>{{cite web|title=Squirrel Monkey|publisher=Rainforest Alliance|url=http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/resources/forest-facts/species-profiles/squirrelmonkey.html|accessdate=2008-10-18}}</ref>  The Central American Squirrel Monkey's brain weighs about {{convert|25.7|g|oz|lk=on|abbr=on}}, or about 4% of its body weight.<ref name=pic/>

Unlike larger relatives, such as the [[capuchin monkey|capuchin]], [[spider monkey|spider]] and [[howler monkey]]s, adult Central American Squirrel Monkeys do not have a fully prehensile tail.  The tail has some flexibility, allowing it to help the monkey cling to a tree.  Newborn infant Central American Squirrel Monkeys do have fully prehensile tails, but lose that feature within a few weeks after birth.

==Distribution and habitat==

The Central American Squirrel Monkey has a restricted distribution in [[Costa Rica]] and [[Panama]].  It lives only near the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast.  Its range covers Central Pacific Costa Rica in the north through western Panama.

The Central American Squirrel Monkey lives lowland forests.<ref name=pic/>  It is restricted to [[secondary forest]]s and also in [[primary forest]]s which have been partially [[logging|logged]].<ref name=costa>{{cite book|title=The Natural History of Costa Rican Mammals|author=Wainwright, M.|year=2002|page=131–134|isbn=0-9705678-1-2}}</ref>  It requires forests with abundant low and mid-level vegetation.<ref name=field/><ref name=costa/>  It has difficulty surviving in tall, mature, undisturbed forests that do not have abundant low level vegetation.<ref name=field/>

The Central American Squirrel Monkey lives in two of Costa Rica's national parks — [[Manuel Antonio National Park]] and [[Corcovado National Park]] — where it can be seen by visitors.<ref name=watching>{{cite book|author = Hunter, L., Andrew, D.|title = ''Watching Wildlife Central America''|year = 2002|pages = 148|isbn=1-86450-034-4}}</ref>  However, it is not as commonly seen in these parks as the [[White-headed Capuchin]] or the [[Mantled Howler]] monkeys.<ref>{{cite book|author = Hunter, L., Andrew, D.|title = ''Watching Wildlife Central America''|year = 2002|pages = 100|isbn=1-86450-034-4}}</ref>

==Behavior==

===Social Structure===

Central American Squirrel Monkeys live in groups containing several adult males, several adult females and juveniles.  The group size tends to be smaller than that of South American squirrel monkeys, but still larger than many other New World Monkey species.  Group size generally numbers between 20 and 75 monkeys, with a mean group size of 41 monkeys.<ref name=costa/><ref name=perspective/>  Groups in excess of 100 sometimes occur, but these are generally believed to be temporary mergers of two groups.<ref name=iucn/>  On average, groups contain about 60% more females than males.<ref name=perspective/>  

The squirrel monkey groups have a home range of between 35 and 63 hectares.<ref name=costa/>  Group ranges can overlap, especially in large, protected areas such as [[Manuel Antonio National Park]].  Less overlap occurs in more fragmented areas.<ref name=costa/>  Groups can cover 2500 to 4200 meters per day.<ref name=sussman>{{cite book|title=Primate Ecology and Social Structure Volume 2: New World Monkeys|edition=Revised First Edition|author=Sussman, R.|year=2003|page=86|isbn=0-536-74364-9}}</ref>  Unlike, some other monkey species, the group does not split into separate foraging groups during the day.  But individual monkeys may separate for the main group to engage in different activities (e.g., foraging, playing, resting) for periods of time, and thus the group may be deispersed over an area of up to three acres at any given time.<ref name=boinski>{{cite book|title=The Primate Anthology|chapter=Monkeys with Inflated Sex Appeal|author=Boinski, S.|editor=Ciochon, R. & Nisbett, R.|page=174–179|year=1992|isbn=0-13-613845-4}}</ref>   The group tends to sleep in the same trees every night for months at a time, unlike other squirrel monkeys.<ref name=boinski/>

There are no dominance hierarchies among the females, and the females do not form coalitions.<ref name=iucn/><ref name=perspective/>  Males only form dominance hierarchies during breeding season.<ref name=perspective/>  Males in the group are generally related to each other and thus tend to form strong affiliations.<ref name=perspective/>  This is especially the case among males of the same age.<ref name=costa/>  Neither males nor females are dominant over each other.  The Central American Squirrel Monkey's egalitarian social system is unique to Central American squirrel monkeys.  In South American species, either the females (''S. boliviensis'') or males (''S. sciureus'') are dominant over the other sex, and both sexes form stable dominance hierarchies.<ref name=perspective/>  Groups generally do not compete or fight with each other.<ref name=iucn/>  Males are primarily responsible for watching for predators.<ref name=iucn/>

Although South American species of squirrel monkeys often travel with and feed together with [[capuchin monkey]]s, the Central American Squirrel Monkey only rarely associates with the [[White-headed Capuchin]].  This appears to be related to the fact that the distribution food that the Central American Squirrel Monkey eats, differs from that of the South American squirrel monkeys.  As a result of the different food distribution, associating with capuchin monkeys would impose higher foraging costs for the Central American Squirrel Monkey than for their South American counterparts.  In addition, while male [[White-headed Capuchin]]s are alert to predators, they devote more attention to detecting rival males than to detecting predators.  Therefore, associating with capuchins would provide less predator detection benefits and impose higher foraging costs on the Central American Squirrel Monkey than on South American squirrel monkeys.<ref name=perspective>{{cite book|title=Primates in Perspective|chapter=The Cebines|author=Jack, K.|editor = Campbell, C., Fuentes, A., MacKinnon, K., Panger, M., & Bearder, S.|year=2007|page=107–120|isbn=978-0-19-517133-4}}</ref><ref name=move>{{cite book|title=On the Move|chapter=Social Manipulation Within and Between Troops Mediates Primate Group Movement|author=Boinski, S.|editor=Boinski, S. and Garber, P.|page=447–448|year=2000|isbn=0-226-06340-2}}</ref>

Certain bird species associate with the Central American Squirrel Monkey.  The birds follow the monkeys in a attempt to prey on insects and small vertebrates that the monkeys flush out.  At [[Corcovado National Park]], bird species known to regularly follow squirrel monkeys include the [[Double-toothed Kite]], the [[Grey-headed Tanager]] and the [[Tawny-winged Woodcreeper]], but other species, such as other [[woodcreeper]]s, [[motmot]]s, [[trogon]]s, and even some birds of prey do so as well.  This activity increases during the wet season, when [[arthropod]]s are harder to find.<ref name=costa/>

===Diet===
[[Image:Central American Squirrel Monkey 3.jpeg|thumb|right|Central American Squirrel Monkey foraging in [[Manuel Antonio National Park]] in [[Costa Rica]]]]

The Central American Squirrel Monkey is [[omnivore|omnivorous]].  Its diet includes insects and insect larvae (especially [[grasshopper]]s and [[caterpillar]]s), spiders, fruit, leaves, bark, flowers and nectar.  It also eats small [[vertebrate]]s, including bats, birds, lizards and frogs.  It finds its food foraging through the lower and middle levels of the forest, typically between fifteen and thirty feet high.<ref name=costa/><ref name=boinski/>

It has a unique method of capturing [[Tent-making Bat]]s.  It looks for roosting bats by looking for their tents (which are made of a folded leaf).  When it finds a bat it climbs to a higher level and jumps onto the tent from above, attempting to dislodge the bat.  If the fallen bat doesn't fly away in time, the monkey pounces on it on the ground and eats it.<ref name=costa/> 

It eats a wide variety of fruits.  Fruits eaten include [[cecropia]]s, [[legume]]s, [[fig]]s, [[palm tree|palms]], [[Symphonia globulifera|cerillo]], [[Pseudolmedia|quiubra]], [[Xylopia|yayo flaco]], wild [[cashew]] fruits, and fruits from relatives of the [[black pepper]] and [[coffee]] plants.<ref name=costa/><ref name=boinski/>

The Central American Squirrel Monkey is believed to be an important seed disperser.  It is also believed to be a pollenator of certain flowers, including the [[passion flower]].  While it is not a significant agricultural pest, it does sometimes eat corn, coffee, [[banana]]s and [[mango]]s.

Two thirds to three quarters of each day is spent foraging for food.  It has difficulty finding its desired food late in the wet season, when fewer [[arthropods]] are available to eat.<ref name=field/>

===Communication===

The Central American Squirrel Monkey is noisy.  It makes many squeals, whistles and chirps.<ref name=field/>  It also travels through the forest noisily, disturbing vegetation as it moves through.<ref name=field/>  Its has four main calls, which have been described as a ""smooth chuck"", a ""bent mask chuck"", a ""peep"" and a ""twitter"".<ref name=pic/>

===Predators===

Predators of the Central American Squirrel Monkey include [[bird of prey|raptor]]s, [[Felidae|cats]] and snakes.  Both constricting and venomous snakes prey on squirrel monkeys.  Raptors are particularly effective predators of Central American Squirrel Monkeys.<ref name=perspective/>  The oldest males bear most of the responsibility for detecting predators.<ref name=costa/>  When a Central American Squirrel Monkey detects a raptor, it gives a high-pitched alarm peep and dives for cover.  All other squirrel monkeys that hear the alarm call also dive for cover.  The monkeys are particularly cautious about raptors, and give alarms and dive for cover when they detect any raptor-like object, including small [[airplane]]s and even falling branches and large leaves.<ref name=boinski/>

Predator detection by the males becomes particularly important during the period when the infants are born.  Raptors spend significantly more time near the squirrel monkey troops during this period, and prey on a significant number of the newborn infants.  Other animals that prey on Central American Squirrel Monkey infants include [[toucan]]s, [[tayra]]s, [[opossum]]s, [[coati]]s, snakes, and even [[spider monkey]]s.<ref name=boinski/>

==Reproduction==
[[Image:Central American Squirrel Monkey baby gets a ride.jpeg|thumb|left|Two month old infant riding on mother's back]]

The breeding season for the Central American Squirrel Monkey is in September.<ref name=costa/>  All females come into [[Estrous cycle|estrus]] at virtually the same time.  A month or two before the breeding season begins, males become larger.  This is not due to extra muscle, but due to altered water balance within the male's body.  This, in turn, is caused by the male hormone [[testosterone]] being converted to [[estrogen]].  The more testosterone a male produces, the more he grows in advance of the breeding season.  Since males within a group have not been observed fighting over access to females during breeding season, nor attempting to force females to copulate with them, it is believed that female choice determines which males get to breed with females.  And females tend to prefer the males that expand the most in advance of breeding season.  This may be because the most enlarged males are generally the oldest and the most effective at detecting predators.  Or this may be a case of runaway [[sexual selection|intersexual selection]].<ref name=boinski/>

Males sometimes leave their group for short periods of time during the breeding season in order to try to mate with females from neighboring groups.  Females are receptive to males from other groups, although resident males attempt to repel the intruding males.  The [[gestation period]] is six months, and the infants are born within the span of a single week during February and March.  A single infant is typically born.<ref name=costa/><ref name=perspective/><ref name=boinski/>

The infant remains dependent on its mother for about one year.<ref name=costa/>  Females give birth every 12 months, so the prior infant becomes independent at about the same time the new infant is born.  Females become sexually mature at 2 1/2 years old, while males become sexually mature at between 4 and 5 years old.<ref name=perspective/>  The females leave their natal group upon reaching sexual maturity, while males usually remain with their natal group their entire lives.  This is different from South American squirrel monkey species, where either males disperse from their natal group or both sexes disperse.<ref name=perspective/>  Males of the same age tend to associate with each other in age cohorts.  If upon reaching sexual maturity, an age cohort may choose to leave the group and attempt to oust the males from another group in order to attain increased reproductive opportunities.<ref name=perspective/>

The lifespan of the Central American Squirrel Monkey in the wild is unknown, but captive specimens have been know to live more than 15 years.<ref name=costa/>  Other squirrel monkey species are known to be able to live more than 20 years.<ref name=perspective/>

==Status==
It was once believed that the Central American Squirrel Monkey was just a population of a South American species of squirrel monkey brought to Central America by humans. Evidence for this theory included the very small range of the Central American Squirrel Monkey and the large gap from the range of any other squirrel monkey species. However, a study of [[nuclear DNA|nuclear]] and [[mitochondrial DNA]] demonstrated that the Central American Squirrel Monkey is indeed a separate species that apparently diverged from the South American species long ago - at least 260,000 years ago and possibly more than 4 million years ago.<ref name=perspectives>{{cite book | author = Rylands, A.; Groves, C.; Mittenmeier, R.; Cortes-Ortiz, L.; Hines, J.| editor = Estrada, A.; Garber, P.A.; Pavelka, M.S.M.; Luecke, L. | chapter = Taxonomy and Distributions of Mesoamerican Primates | title = New Perspectives in the Study of Mesoamerican Primates| pages = p. 38| id = ISBN 978-0-387-25854-6 | year = 2006}}</ref>

[[Image:Central American Squirrel Monkey 7.jpeg|thumb|left|Wild Central American Squirrel Monkey encroaching on a balcony of a development near [[Manuel Antonio National Park]]]]
One popular theory is that squirrel monkeys did live in Columbia during the late [[Miocene]] or [[Pliocene]] and these squirrel monkeys migrated to Central America, becoming the ancestors of the current Central American species. According to this theory, the [[Guatemalan Black Howler]] migrated to Central America around the same time. However, passage through the [[isthmus]] of [[Panama]] later closed due to rising oceans, and later opened up to another wave of migration about 2 million years ago. These later migrants, ancestors to modern populations of [[White-headed Capuchin]]s, [[Mantled Howler]]s and [[Geoffroy's Spider Monkey]]s, outcompeted the earlier migrants, leading to the small range of the Central American Squirrel Monkey (as well as the Guatemalan Black Howler).<ref>{{cite book | author = Ford, S.| editor = Estrada, A.; Garber, P.A.; Pavelka, M.S.M.; Luecke, L. | chapter = The Biographic History of Mesoamerican Primates | title = New Perspectives in the Study of Mesoamerican Primates| pages = pp. 100-107| id = ISBN 978-0-387-25854-6 | year = 2006}}</ref>

It has been estimated that the population of the Central American Squirrel Monkey has been reduced from about 200,000 in the 1970s to less than 5000.<ref name=watching/>  This is believed to be largely due to [[deforestation]], [[hunting]], and capture for the [[pet]] trade.<ref name=watching/> There are significant efforts within Costa Rica to try to preserve this monkey from extinction.<ref>[http://www.theboquetetimes.com/html/squirlmonkey.html Saving the Central American Squirrel Monkey<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.ascomoti.com/index.html Save the Mono Titi Manuel Antonio Costa Rica<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A reforestation project within Panama tries to preserve the vanishing population of the Chiriqui Province <ref>[http://www.saimiri.org/en -->]</ref>.

The population density has been estimated at 36 monkeys per kilometer in Costa Rica and 130 monkeys per kilometer in Panama.<ref name=sussman/>

As of 2008, the Central American Squirrel Monkey is listed as ""vulnerable"" from a conservation standpoint by the [[IUCN]].  This is due to the fact that its range encompasses just 8000 square [[kilometer]]s, its range is fragmented, and it suffers from ongoing habitat loss.  However, this assessment is an improvement from the 2003 assessment, in which the Central American Squirrel Monkey was listed as ""endangered"".<ref name=iucn/>

==Taxonomy==
The Central American Squirrel Monkey is a member of the family [[Cebidae]], the family of [[New World monkeys]] containing [[capuchin monkey]]s, [[squirrel monkey]]s, [[tamarin]]s and [[marmoset]]s.  Within the family Cebidae, it is a member of the subfamily [[Saimiriinae]], the subfamily containing squirrel monkeys.<ref name=groves2>{{MSW3 Groves|page=Saimiriinae|id=12100283}}</ref>  It is one of five recognized species of squirrel monkey, and the only species occurring outside South America.<ref name=perspective/>  The Central American Squirrel Monkey is placed in genus ''[[Saimiri]]'' (Voigt, 1831) along with all the other squirrel monkey species.

There are two subspecies of the Central American Squirrel Monkey:<ref name=msw3/>

* [[Black-crowned Central American Squirrel Monkey]], ''Saimiri oerstedii oerstedii''
* [[Grey-crowned Central American Squirrel Monkey]], ''Saimiri oerstedii citrinellus''

''S. o. oerstadii'' lives in the western [[Pacific]] portion of Panama and the [[Osa Peninsula]] area of Costa Rica (including [[Corcovado National Park]]), while ''S. o. citrinellus'' lives in the Central Pacific portion of Costa Rica.  It has been estimated (most recently in 2003) that the remaining wild population of ''S. o. citrinellus'' is only about 1300 to 1800 individuals.<ref name=iucn/>

{{Campaignbox Second Coalition}}

The '''Battle of Höchstädt''' was fought on 19 June 1800 on the north bank of the [[Danube]] near [[Höchstädt an der Donau|Höchstädt]], and resulted in a French victory under General [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau]] against the [[Austria]]ns under Baron [[Pál Kray]]. The Austrians were subsequently forced back into the fortress town of [[Ulm]]. Instead of attacking the heavily fortified, walled city, which would result in massive losses of personnel and time, Moreau dislodged Kray's supporting forces defending the Danube passage further east.  As a line of retreat eastward disappeared, Kray quickly abandoned Ulm, and withdrew into [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]]. This opened the Danube pathway toward [[Vienna]].

The Danube passage connecting Ulm, [[Donauworth]], [[Ingolstadt]] and [[Regensburg]] had strategic importance in the ongoing competition for European hegemony between France and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; the army that commanded the Danube, especially its passage through [[Duchy of Württemberg|Württemberg]] and Bavaria, could command access to the important cities of [[Munich]] and the seat of Habsburg authority: Vienna.  The end result of the battle was the opposite of what had occurred on those same fields almost 100 years earlier, when the armies of the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]] had faced the armies of France during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. At the Second Battle of Höchstädt in 1704, called the [[Battle of Blenheim]] by the English, the overwhelming Allied victory ensured the safety of Vienna from the Franco-Bavarian army, thus preventing the collapse of the Grand Alliance. France's loss during that engagement opened the pathway into France for the allied English and Austrian forces.

==Background==
{{main|French Revolutionary Wars}}

Although the [[First Coalition]] forces achieved several initial victories at [[Battle of Verdun (1792)|Verdun]], [[Battle of Kaiserslautern|Kaiserslautern]], [[Battle of Neerwinden (1793)|Neerwinden]], [[Battle of Mainz|Mainz]], [[Battle of Amberg|Amberg]] and [[Battle of Wurzburg|Wurzburg]], the efforts of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in northern [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|Italy]] pushed Austrian forces back and resulted in the negotiation of the [[Peace of Leoben]] (17&nbsp;April 1797) and the subsequent [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] (October 1797).<ref>Timothy Blanning, ''The French Revolutionary Wars'', New York, Oxford University Press, pp. 41–59.</ref>  This treaty proved difficult to administer. Austria was slow to give up some of the Venetian territories. A Congress convened at Rastatt for the purposes of deciding which southwestern German states would be [[German mediatization|mediatised]] to compensate the dynastic houses for territorial losses, but was unable to make any progress. Supported by French republican forces, Swiss insurgents staged several uprisings, ultimately causing the overthrow of the [[Old Swiss Confederation|Swiss Confederation]] after 18&nbsp;months of civil war.<ref>Blanning, pp. 200–280.</ref> By early 1799, the [[French Directory]] had become impatient with stalling tactics employed by Austria. An uprising in Naples raised further alarms, and recent gains in Switzerland suggested the timing was fortuitous for the French to venture on another campaign in northern Italy and southwestern Germany.<ref>Blanning, p. 200.</ref>
[[File:Hohentwiel-luftbild.jpg|thumbnail||The Battles of Stockach and Engen in May 1800, followed by a larger battle at Messkirch, followed the Hohentwiel capitulation to the French]]
At the beginning of 1800, the armies of France and Austria faced each other across the Rhine.  Feldzeugmeister Pál Kray  led approximately 120,000 troops. In addition to his Austrian regulars, his force included 12,000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria, 6,000 troops from the Duchy of Württemberg, 5,000 soldiers of low quality from the [[Archbishopric of Mainz]], and 7,000 militiamen from the [[County of Tyrol]]. Of these, 25,000 men were deployed east of [[Lake Constance|Lake Constance (Bodensee)]] to protect the [[Vorarlberg]]. Kray posted his main body of 95,000 soldiers in the L-shaped angle where the Rhine changes direction from a westward flow along the northern border of Switzerland to a northward flow along the eastern border of France. Unwisely, Kray set up his main magazine at [[Stockach]], near the northwestern end of Lake Constance, only a day's march from French-held Switzerland.<ref>James R. Arnold, ''Marengo and Hohenlinden: Napoleon's Rise to Power'', Pen & Sword Military, 2005, pp.  197–199.</ref>

General of Division Jean Victor Marie Moreau commanded a modestly-equipped army of 137,000 French troops. Of these, 108,000 troops were available for field operations while the other 29,000 watched the Swiss border and held the Rhine fortresses.  Napoleon Bonaparte  offered a plan of operations based on outflanking the Austrians by a push from Switzerland, but Moreau declined to follow it. Rather, Moreau planned to cross the Rhine near [[Basel]] where the river swung to the north. A French column would distract Kray from Moreau's true intentions by crossing the Rhine from the west. Bonaparte wanted [[Claude Lecourbe]]'s corps to be detached to Italy after the initial battles, but Moreau had other plans.<ref name=Arnold199>Arnold, 199–201</ref>   Through a series of complicated maneuvers in which he flanked, double flanked, and reflanked Kray's army, Moreau's forces lay on the eastern slope of the [[Black Forest]], while portions of Kray's army was still guarding the passes on the other side.<ref>W.M. Sloane, ''Life of Napoleon.'' France, 1896, p. 109.</ref>   [[Battle of Stockach (1800)|Battles at Engen and Stockach]] were fought on 3 May 1800 between the Moreau's and Kray's armies.  The fighting near [[Engen, Germany|Engen]] resulted in a stalemate with heavy losses on both sides. However, while the two main armies were engaged at Engen, Claude Lecourbe captured Stockach from its Austrian defenders under the Joseph, Prince of Lorraine-Vaudemont. The loss of this main supply base at Stockach compelled Kray to retreat north to [[Messkirch]], where his army enjoyed a more favorable defensive position. It also meant, however, that any retreat by Kray into Austria via Switzerland and the [[Voralberg]] was cut off.<ref>Sloane, 109</ref>

On 4 and 5 May, the French launched repeated and fruitless assaults on the Messkirch. At nearby [[Sauldorf|Krumbach]], where the Austrians also had the superiority of position and force, the 1st Demi-Brigade took the village and the heights around it, which gave them a commanding aspect over Messkirch.  Subsequently, Kray withdrew his forces  to [[Sigmaringen]], followed closely by the French. Fighting at nearby [[Battle of Biberach (1800)|Biberach an der Ris]] ensued on 9 May; action principally consisted of the 25,000  man-strong French ""Center"", commanded by [[Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr]] against a Habsburg force of similar size.<ref>Sloane, pp. 109–110.</ref>  Again, on 10 May, the Austrians withdrew with heavy losses, this time to Ulm.<ref>Digby Smith, ''Napoleonic Wars Databook.'' London: Greenhill Press, 1998, p. 178.</ref>

==Order of battle==

===French===
[[File:Jean_Victor_Marie_Moreau_(1792).jpg|thumbnail|Jean Victor Moreau commanded the French Army of the Rhine.]]
Sources are unclear which forces were present.  Certainly, it was approximately 40,000 troops, and possibly 60,000, well above the 10,000–30,000 total Austrian and Württemberg numbers.  Contemporary accounts place the 94th Demi-brigade at the center of action in [[Gremheim]], a village between Höchstädt and Donauwörth, about {{convert|.5|mi|km}} from Blindheim.<ref>History, p. 183.</ref>  This suggests the presence of General Claude Jacques Lecourbe 's Corps, including the forces of generals [[Anne Gilbert de Laval|Laval]], [[Gabriel Jean Joseph Molitor|Molitor]], [[Henri-Antoine Jardon|Jardon]], and [[Dominique Vandamme|VanDamme]].<ref>Smith, p. 177.</ref>  This is also confirmed in an extract of Moreau's dispatch to the French Minister of War, published in the <u>London Chronicle</u>, 10 June 1800.  ""The 6th chasseurs, 13th cavalry, 4th hussars and 11th chasseurs distinguished themselves in this affair.  The rest of the division, and that of LeClere, passed rapidly the Danube... General Grenier was equally well prepared.""<ref>''Extract of a letter from Gen. Moreau to the Minister of War, Neresheim, June 20.''<u> The London Chronicle.</u> vol. 87., Found in Willem Lodewyk,  Van-Es, ''The Life of Napoleon Buonaparte ...: With a Concise History of the Events'' W.

Total Austrian/Württemberg force: 20,000 men.<ref name=""Smith, 178""/>

==Dispositions==
Kray assumed that Moreau would follow him to fortress at Ulm, on the Danube, where he arrayed most of the Austrian regulars and Württemberg contingent and supplies.  This position gave him ready access to both shores of the river and effectively, he assumed, blocked Moreau's path into Bavaria.  At several points east on the Danube,  he posted modest forces to protect the river crossings there, and to dismantle, if necessary, the stone bridges across the river. Several bridges crossed the river between Ulm and [[Donauwörth]], which lay downstream to the east, and each presented a strategic point at which to rupture Kray's potential line of march into Bavaria: [[Leipheim]], [[Gunzburg]], [[Gundelfingen an der Donau|Gundelfingen]],[[Lauingen]], [[Dillingen an der Donau|Dillingen]], [[Höchstädt]], [[Steinheim]], Gremheim, and [[Elchingen]].<ref name=""ReferenceA"">''Extract of a letter from Gen. Moreau...''</ref>

According to Moreau's narrative, he intended to force Kray to either come to battle outside Ulm, or to abandon the city.  Ulm obstructed unfettered French access into Bavaria, and blocked the main force of the Army of the Rhine.<ref name=""ReferenceA""/>  To keep his forces secure, accepted military wisdom required that Moreau secure at least half of the crossings of the river, and that his troops follow a line of march perpendicular to the river.  This would prevent them from having to fight a battle (or a skirmish) with their backs to the river.  The more bridges his force could take, the more secure the approach on Ulm.<ref>Jomini, p. 173.</ref>

==General engagement==

Moreau appeared to march toward Ulm, which lay some twenty miles east of Sigmaringen and Biberach an der Ris, where his army and Kray's had engaged a few days earlier.  Instead of striking directly at the well-fortified and supplied city, however, his  force suddenly veered to the east and struck at the smaller forces posted between Ulm and Donauwörth.<ref>David Eggenberger, ""Höchstädt II"", ''An Encyclopedia of Battles'', Dover Publications, 2014, p. 193.</ref>  Lecourbe first secured posts in [[Landsberg am Lech|Landsberg]] and [[Augsburg]], and left sufficient rearguard troops to protect himself from [[Prince Heinrich XV of Reuss-Plauen|Prince Reuss-Plauen]], who remained in the Tyrol guarding mountain access to Vienna.  He then approached Dettingen, Blindheim (Blenheim) and Höchstädt.  The Corps of General [[Paul Grenier|Grenier]] has been posted with their right flank to the Danube and Gunzburg, and their left flank at Kinsdorf.  General [[Antoine Richepanse|Richepanse]]  protected both shores of the [[Iller]], covering the road from Ulm south to [[Memmingen]], and secured communication with Switzerland; there, he withstood considerable skirmishing with the Austrians.  Three divisions of reserve remained at the hamlets of Kamlack and Mindel, to support the attack made by General Lecourbe on Ulm, in a case it should succeed, or Grenier's attack upon Gunzburg, in case Lecourbe should not succeed.<ref name=""ReferenceA""/>

Lecourbe made several feints on the bridge at Dillingheim, but his reconnaissance suggested instead that he focus on the bridges at Gremsheim, Blindheim and Höchstädt, which he did the next day.<ref name=""ReferenceA""/>  A small group of 80 or so men from the 94th Demi-Brigade managed a spectacular crossing of the river.  After stripping their clothing and weapons, and loading them into a small raft, the naked men swam the river, pulling their weapons on rafts behind them.  Once reaching the other side, they took possession of several guns and some ammunition, wood, and materials.  Here they held their position until some artillery men managed to scramble across the wreck of the bridge at Gremsheim and support them.  The [[Pioneer (military)|pioneers]] and bridge builders reconstructed the bridges under Austrian fire, allowing the remainder of the 94th crossed the river.<ref>""Höchstädt"", ''History of the Wars of the French Revolution: Including Sketches of the Civil History of Great Britain and France, from the Revolutionary Movements, 1788, to the Restoration of a General Peace, 1815'', Kuhl, France, 1820, p. 181.</ref>  This accomplishment seemed to mark the turning point of the action, at least it did to Moreau, who mentioned it at length in his dispatch.<ref name=""ReferenceA""/> A full Austrian Corps maintained a stand at Höchstädt, but were dislodged by repeated attacks of [[carabine]]rs, [[Cuirass|curassier]]s and hussars, who took about 2,000 of the Austrians and Würtembergers as prisoners, along with some cannons and standards.<ref name=""ReferenceA""/>

==Aftermath==
[[File:Leopold Kupelwieser 001.jpg|thumbnail|left|Emperor Francis II replaced Paul Kray (1735–1804) with his brother, Archduke John (above), after the Kray's losses in the Danube campaign.]]
Once the French had secured the downstream shores of the Danube, Kray had no choice but to evacuate his corps from Ulm, leaving only a small garrison behind.  The French invested the fortress at Ulm immediately, and on the 20th, the 6th Chasseurs captured a convoy of 300 wagons loaded with grain.<ref name=""ReferenceA""/>  A few days later, a general armistice halted all fighting.  [[Francis II of Austria|Emperor Francis II]] dismissed Feldzeugmeister (FZM) [[Pál Kray]] and appointed his brother, the 18-year-old General-Major [[Archduke John]], to command the Austrian army. To bolster the inexperienced archduke, the emperor named FZM [[Franz von Lauer]] as deputy commander and [[Oberst]] ([[Colonel]]) [[Franz von Weyrother]] as [[Chief of Staff]].<ref>Arnold, pp. 205, 213.</ref>

The campaign culminating in Kray's evacuation of Ulm was one of Moreau's most resounding triumphs.   Napoleon Bonaparte had given Moreau specific instructions about the conduct of the campaign, all of which Moreau had ignored. Regardless, their combined efforts damaged Habsburg military operations.  In Spring 1800, while Moreau wrecked Austrian defenses in Germany, [[Massena]] and [[Desaix]] ran into stiff Austrian offensives in Northern Italy. Napoleon brought in the reserve corps and defeated the Austrians at [[Battle of Marengo|Marengo]]. The battle near Höchstädt, five days after the Austrian disaster at Marengo, allowed the French to take Munich. The combined efforts forced the Habsburgs to accept an armistice ended hostilities for the rest of the summer, but the French extracted massive levies on the Bavarians. Despite these significant losses—both of them decisive—the Austrians were reluctant to accept disadvantageous peace terms.  In mid-November, the French ended the truce and Moreau inflicted another significant and decisive defeat at [[Battle of Hohenlinden|Hohenlinden]] on 3 December 1800.<ref>Gregory Fremont Barnes. ''Napoleon Bonaparte''.  Osprey Publishing, 2012, p. 73.</ref>  The subsequent [[Peace of Lunéville]] stripped Austria of much of her Italian territories, obliged the [[Habsburg]]s to recognize the French satellites in the Low Countries, Switzerland, and northern Italy, and laid the groundwork for the mediatization of the small independent ecclesiastical and secular imperial polities by the duchies of [[Duchy of Baden|Baden]] and Württemberg, and the Electorate of Bavaria.<ref>Rothenberg, pp. 43–44.</ref>

'''Den Brook Wind Farm''' is a proposed [[windfarm]] in [[Devon]], [[England]]. The windfarm will be located {{convert|2|km}} south-east of [[North Tawton]] and {{convert|2.5|km}} south-west of [[Bow, Devon|Bow]], and will comprise nine [[wind turbine]]s, each {{convert|120|m}} high. Developer [[Renewable Energy Systems]] (RES) received [[planning consent]] for the project in December 2009,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.den-brook.co.uk/media/16981/RES%20WELCOMES%20APPROVAL%20OF%20DEN%20BROOK%20WIND%20FARM_111209final.pdf |title=RES welcomes approval of Den Brook Wind Farm |publisher=RES |date=11 December 2011}}</ref> following a long planning process which included two [[public inquiry|public inquiries]] and a [[judicial review]]. 

RES initially put forward proposals for a windfarm at Den Brook in 2004, and in response the Den Brook Valley Action Group was established to oppose the plan. A key concern was the potential impact of noise on local residents. In 2006, [[West Devon|West Devon Borough Council]] refused planning permission for the scheme, but RES appealed, and consent was granted in early 2007 following a public inquiry. Still concerned about noise issues, local residents the formed Den Brook Judicial Review Group which pursued a judicial appeal. This resulted in the inquiry decision being overturned, and a second public inquiry was held in October 2009, following which permission was once more granted, subject to a number of planning conditions. A second legal challenge was rejected in August 2010.<ref name=bbcaug2010>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-11029757 |title=Den Brook wind turbine challenge rejected by High Court |publisher=BBC News |date=19 August 2010}}</ref> In 2011, the windfarm was the subject of a television documentary series, ''Windfarm Wars'', broadcast by [[BBC Two]], which followed the history of the project.<ref name=windfarmwars>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00zzwv6 |title=Windfarm Wars|publisher=BBC Television |accessdate=1 June 2011 }}</ref>

==Planning history==
RES initially publicised two alternate proposals for Den Brook in 2004: a scheme of ten {{convert|100|m|adj=on}} turbines; and a scheme of 19 {{convert|80|m|adj=on}} turbines. Following consultation, a layout of nine {{convert|120|m|adj=on}} turbines was developed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.den-brook.co.uk/about-the-project/project-layout-infrastructure.aspx |title=Project Layout and infrastructure |work=Den Brook Wind Farm |publisher=RES |accessdate=9 June 2011}}</ref> Also in 2004, RES erected an [[anemometer]] mast to measure wind speed, and undertook [[background noise]] monitoring.<ref name=storysofar>{{cite web |url=http://www.denbrookvalley.co.uk/3.html |title=The Story so Far... |publisher=Den Brook Judicial Review Group |accessdate=9 June 2011}}</ref>  

===Planning application===
By April 2005, Den Brook Valley Action Group (DBVAG) had been formed, and was flying a balloon at the site to mark the height of the proposed turbines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/4496321.stm |title=Balloon shows wind turbine height |publisher=BBC News |date=29 April 2005}}</ref> The planning application was submitted to West Devon Borough Council (WDBC) in November 2005.<ref name=application>{{cite web |url=http://www.westdevon.gov.uk/PlanningApplicationSearch/Disclaimer.aspx?PlanningID=8250%2f2005%2fOKE |title=Planning Application 8250/2005/OKE |publisher=West Devon Borough Council |accessdate=9 June 2011}}</ref> Objections to the proposal came from the [[Campaign to Protect Rural England]], [[Mid Devon|Mid Devon District Council]], and from 2,915 objection letters, all citing grounds including visual impact, noise, and residential amenity.<ref name=WDBCreport>{{cite web |url=http://www.westdevon.gov.uk/upload/public/attachments/500/oke%20apps%283%29.pdf |publisher=West Devon Borough Council |date=31 January 2006 |title=Planning & Licensing Committee: Planning Applications and Enforcement Reports (Northern Area)}}</ref> [[Dartmoor National Park]] and the [[Dartmoor Preservation Association]] also objected, as the site is located around {{convert|5.5|km}} from the national park boundary.<ref name=WDBCreport/> 71 letters of support were also received.<ref name=WDBCreport/> WDBC planning officers recommended refusal of planning permission, on the grounds of visual impacts, and potential impacts on the historic environment.<ref name=WDBCreport/> On 31 January 2006 the council voted to accept the recommendation, and refused planning permission.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/4666562.stm |title=Windfarm plan refused by council  |publisher=BBC News |date=31 January 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.res-group.com/media/230761/den%20brook%20decision.pdf |title=Den Brook decision: a missed opportunity to take positive action on climate change |publisher=RES |date=31 January 2006}}</ref>

Four months later, RES announced their intention to appeal to the [[Planning Inspectorate]] against the decision, and to seek a [[public inquiry]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.res-group.com/media/230757/den%20brook%20appeal%20announcement%20300506.pdf |title=RES to appeal Den Brook Wind Farm decision |date=30 May 2006 |publisher=RES}}</ref> The inquiry was held in November 2006, at which the appeal was opposed by representatives of WDBC and DBVAG. In February 2007 the appeal was allowed by the planning inspector, and planning permission granted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/6353869.stm |title=Green light for appeal wind farm   |publisher=BBC News |date=12 February 2007 }}</ref>

===Judicial review===
In March 2007, the Den Brook Judicial Review Group (DBJRG) was formed by local residents. Headed by Mike Hulme, whose property was one of the closest dwellings to the proposed site, the group came together over concerns regarding the potential for [[noise pollution]] from the turbines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denbrookvalley.co.uk/2.html |title=Den Brook Judicial Review Group: Who we are |publisher=Den Brook Judicial Review Group |accessdate=10 June 2011}}</ref> A key concern was the potential for sleep disturbance due to a phenomenon known as amplitude modulation. This form of noise, which has been reported at a small number of windfarm sites, is poorly understood.<ref>{{cite web |author=Bowdler, Dick |title=Amplitude modulation of wind turbine noise: a review of the evidence |date=June 2008 |publisher=Industrial Wind Action Group }}</ref>

DBJRG launched an appeal, under Section 288 of the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1990]], to the [[High Court of Justice |High Court]], which was heard in March 2008 by Justice Mitting. A key issue was the refusal of RES to release the background noise data to Mr Hulme, to allow independent analysis. Although he criticised the approach taken by RES, Justice Mitting refused to overturn the result of the inquiry, since the planning inspector had not made a legal error in coming to his decision.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denbrookvalley.co.uk/resources/High+Court+Action.pdf |title=Fresh Legal Appeal Launched Against Den Brook Wind Farm |date=March 2008 |publisher=Den Brook Judicial Review Group }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Hulme, R (on the application of) v Secretary of State for Communities & Local Government (2008) EWHC 637 (Admin) |date=19 March 2008 |url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2008/637.html}}</ref> In May, RES released the noise data, and errors were subsequently discovered by DBJRG,<ref name=furtherinformation>{{cite web |url=http://www.denbrookvalley.co.uk/resources/PressRelease_03082008.pdf |title=Den Brook Valley Wind Farm Judicial Review Information: Further Information |date=3 August 2008 |publisher=Den Brook Judicial Review Group }}</ref> although RES denied that they were significant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.den-brook.co.uk/media/51577/den%20brook%20wind%20farm%20will%20not%20cause%20noise%20nuisance%20july%202008.pdf |title=Res reassures residents that Den Brook Wind Farm will not cause a noise nuisance |date=9 July 2008 |publisher=RES}}</ref> DBJRG then took their case to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], and permission to appeal was granted in June 2008.<ref name=storysofar/> To avoid the need for another court hearing a [[consent decree|consent order]] was agreed between DBJRG and the [[Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government]] (the defendant in the case), which had the effect of overturning the planning inquiry, and returning the matter to the Planning Inspectorate.<ref name=furtherinformation/> 

===Second public inquiry===
The second public inquiry was initially scheduled for March 2009, but was postponed at the request of DBJRG, who had not then had sufficient time to review new noise data supplied by RES.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denbrookvalley.co.uk/resources/Press+Release+Feb+2009.pdf |title=Den Brook Wind Farm: Second Public Inquiry Postponed |date=nd. |publisher=Den Brook Judicial Review Group }}</ref> The inquiry took place between July and October 2009, with the appeal being opposed by WDBC, DBJRG, and the Campaign to Protect Rural England.<ref name=decision>{{cite web |url=http://www.denbrookvalley.co.uk/resources/Denbrook+APPEAL+DECISION-1.pdf |title=Appeal Decision: Appeal Ref: APP/Q1153/A/06/2017162, Land to the south east of North Tawton and the south west of Bow |publisher=The Planning inspectorate |date=11 December 2009}}</ref> The appeal was once again allowed in December 2009. A number of planning conditions were attached by the inspector, aimed at reducing the likelihood of noise nuisance.<ref name=decision/>

Following the decision, a second judicial appeal was launched by Mike Hulme, which challenged the validity of the planning conditions and claimed that the wording of the noise conditions rendered them ineffective.<ref name=bbcaug2010/> The case was heard by Judge Frances Patterson [[QC]] in July 2010. All ten grounds of the challenge were rejected by the judge in her decision.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hulme, R (on the application of) v Secretary of State for Communities & Local Government (2010) EWHC 2386 (Admin) |date=19 August 2010 |url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2010/2386.html}}</ref> Hulme went on to lodge an appeal against this decision, which was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in May 2011.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hulme v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government & Anor (2011) EWCA Civ 638 |date=26 May 2011 |url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2011/638.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denbrookvalley.co.uk/index.html |title=Court of Appeal Judgement |date=1 June 2011 |publisher=Den Brook Judicial Review Group}}</ref> Meanwhile, RES have been seeking agreement with WDBC on how the planning conditions will be met.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.den-brook.co.uk/about-the-project/site-progress.aspx |title=Site Progress |publisher=RES |accessdate=10 June 2011}}</ref> 

==''Windfarm Wars''==
The [[BBC]] commissioned a documentary on the development of Den Brook Wind Farm shortly after the inception of the project.<ref name=Gibson>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/tv/2011/05/windfarm-wars.shtml |title=Windfarm Wars: Filming the renewable energy debate in Devon |date=24 May 2011 |author=Gibson, Jeremy |work=BBC TV Blog |publisher=BBC Television}}</ref> Including face-to-face interviews with a number individuals concerned with the windfarm, it focused primarily on Rachel Ruffle, project manager for RES, and Mike Hulme, local resident and member of DBJRG. Initially conceived as a single film, it developed into a series as the planning process became more and more protracted. The timescale also consumed most of the programme budget, with producer Jeremy Gibson eventally completing the films as a solo project.<ref name=Gibson/> The series was first broadcast in May and June 2011.<ref name=windfarmwars/>

Back row: Maggie Jones (harpist of Arfon); Mrs Gruffydd Richards (chief harpist of Gwent), David Roberts (blind harpist of Mawddwy), [[Gwyneth Vaughan]]. Front row: Pedwr James, Emile Hamonic, Léna Botrel, [[Théodore Botrel]], Professor Paul Barbier]]A '''Celtic identity''' emerges in the [[Celtic nations]] of Western Europe in the course of the 19th-century [[Celtic Revival]], taking the form of [[ethnic nationalism]] particularly within the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], where the [[Irish Home Rule Movement]] results in the secession of an [[Irish Free State]] in 1922. 
After World War II, the focus of the ""Celticity"" movement shifted to linguistic revival and protectionism, e.g. with the foundation of the [[Celtic League (political organisation)|Celtic League]] in 1961, dedicated to preserving the surviving [[Celtic languages]].

Since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the term ""Celtic"" has been applied to a wide variety of peoples and cultural traits present and past. Today, ""Celtic"" (sometimes ""modern Celts""{{By whom|date=January 2010}}) is often used in order to describe the people, and their respective cultures and languages:
i.e. the [[Bretons]], the [[Cornish people|Cornish]], the [[Irish people|Irish]] (especially the [[Gaeltacht]]), the [[Manx people]], the [[Scottish people|Scots]] ([[Gàidhealtachd]]) and the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] (Cymry), i.e. the members of the modern ""[[Celtic nations]]"".<ref name=""Amgueddfa 1"">{{cite web|title=Who were the Celts? ... Rhagor|url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/article/1939/|accessdate=2009-12-10|publisher=[[National Museum Cardiff|Amgueddfa Cymru – National Museum Wales]]|date=2007-05-04|work=Amgueddfa Cymru – National Museum Wales website}}</ref> Except for the Bretons (if discounting Norman & Channel Islander connections), all groups mentioned have been subject to strong [[Anglicisation]] since the [[Early Modern period]], and are hence are also described as participating in an [[Anglo-Celtic]] macro-culture.  By the same token, the Bretons have been subject to strong Francification since the [[Early Modern period]], and can similarly be described as participating in a Franco-Celtic macro-culture.

Less common is the assumption of ""Celticity"" for European cultures deriving from [[Continental Celtic]] roots ([[Gauls]] and [[Celtiberians]]).  These were either Romanised or Germanised much earlier, before the Early Middle Ages.  Nevertheless, ""Celtic"" origins are sometimes implied for continental groups such as the [[Asturians]], [[Galician people|Galicians]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[French people|French]], [[Swiss people|Swiss]], Alpine Italians, [[Germans]], or [[Austrians]].  The names of  [[Belgium]] and the [[Aquitaine]] hark back to ''[[Gallia Belgica]]'' and ''[[Gallia Aquitania]]'', respectively, in turn named for the [[Belgae]] and the [[Aquitani]].  The Latin name of the [[Swiss Confederacy]], ''Confoederatio Helvetica'', harks back to the [[Helvetii]], the name of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] to the [[Gallaeci]].

==Celtic revival and Romanticism==
{{See|Celtic Revival}}
'Celt' has been adopted as a label of self-identification by a variety of peoples at different times. 'Celticity' can refer to the inferred links between them.

During the 19th century, French nationalists gave a privileged significance to their descent from the [[Gauls]]. The struggles of [[Vercingetorix]] were portrayed as a forerunner of the 19th-century struggles in defence of French nationalism, including the wars of both Napoleons ([[Napoleon I of France]] and [[Napoleon III of France]]). Basic French history textbooks emphasised the ways in which Gauls could be seen as an example of cultural assimilation; however, the notion that French history textbooks commonly began with the famous words ''""Nos ancêtres les Gaulois...""'' (""Our ancestors the Gauls..."") is not supported in fact.<ref>{{Weber, Eugen. ""Gauls versus Franks: Conflict and Nationalistm"" in ''Nationhood and nationalism in France'',edited by Robert Tombs}}</ref> A similar use of ""celticity"" for 19th century nationalism was made in [[Switzerland]], when the Swiss were seen to originate in the Celtic tribe of the [[Helvetii]], a link still found in the official Latin name of Switzerland, ''Confœderatio Helvetica'', the source of the nation code CH.  

Before the advance of [[Indo-European studies]], [[philology|philologists]] established that there was a relationship between the [[Goidelic]] and [[Brythonic languages]], as well as a relationship between these languages and the extinct Celtic languages such as [[Gaulish]], spoken in classical times. The terms Goidelic and Brythonic were first used to describe the two [[Celtic languages|Celtic language families]] by [[Edward Lhuyd]] in his 1707 study and, according to the [[National Museum Cardiff|National Museum Wales]], during that century ""people who spoke Celtic languages were seen as Celts.""<ref name=""Amgueddfa 1""/>

At the same time, there was also a tendency to play up alternative heritages in the [[British Isles]] at certain times. For example, in the Isle of Man, in the [[Victorian era]], the ""[[Viking]]"" heritage was emphasised, and in Scotland, both Norse and [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] heritage was played up.

A [[Romanticism|romantic]] image of the Celt as [[noble savage]] was cultivated by the early [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Lady Gregory]], [[Lady Charlotte Guest]], [[Lady Llanover]], [[James Macpherson]], [[François-René de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]], [[Théodore Hersart de la Villemarqué]] and the many others influenced by them. This image coloured not only the [[England|English]] perception of their neighbours on the so-called ""[[Celt belt|Celtic fringe]]"" (compare the [[stage Irishman]]), but also [[Irish nationalism]] and its analogues in the other Celtic-speaking countries. Among the enduring products of this resurgence of interest in a romantic, pre-industrial, brooding, mystical Celticity are [[Gorsedd]]au, the revival of the [[Cornish language]], and the revival of the [[Gaelic games]].

During the [[Second World War]] many [[Breton people|Breton]] nationalists collaborated with the Nazis, not least against the [[French resistance]]. After the War some of these collaborators settled in Ireland.<ref>Daniel, A. Le Mouvement Breton, pps 303-6</ref>

==Cold War period (1945-1989)==
[[Irish nationalism|Nationalists]] in [[Northern Ireland]] sought an end to endemic discrimination with the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Ulster Scots (Scots Irish) have constantly sought to maintain their independence, identity and culture, and the Ulster workers' strike bought down the British-imposed power sharing arrangements in 1974 <ref>Tim Pat Coogan, The Troubles, Arrow Books 1996, pps.200-02</ref>. Breton regionalists participated in the [[May 1968 revolt]] under Breton flags and with the slogan ''Bretagne=Colonie''. 

==Contemporary Celtic identity (1989 to present)==
[[Image:Chwe Chenedl Geltaidd.png|thumb|280px|The six ""Celtic nations"" within their modern borders are shown in yellow.]]
 
The ""modern Celtic"" groups' distinctiveness as ''national'', as opposed to regional, minorities has been periodically recognised by major British papers. For example, a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' editorial in 1990 pointed to these differences, and said that they should be constitutionally recognised:
:""''Smaller minorities also have equally proud visions of themselves as irreducibly Welsh, Irish, Manx or Cornish. These identities are ''distinctly national'' in ways which ''proud people from [[Yorkshire]]'', much less proud people from [[Berkshire]] will never know. Any new constitutional settlement ''which ignores these factors'' will be built on uneven ground.''""<ref>''[[The Guardian]]'', editorial, 8 May 1990</ref>

The [[Republic of Ireland]], on surpassing [[UK|Britain]]'s [[GDP]] per capita in the 1990s for the first time in centuries, was given the moniker ""[[Celtic tiger]]"". Thanks in part to agitation on the part of Cornish regionalists, [[Cornwall]] was able to obtain [[Objective One]] funding from the [[European Union]]. Scotland and Wales obtained agencies like the [[Welsh Development Agency]], and Scottish and Welsh Nationalists have recently supported the institution of the [[Scottish Parliament]] and [[National Assembly for Wales]]. More broadly, a distinct identity in opposition to that of the metropolitan capitals has been forged and taken strong root. 

These latter evolutions have proceeded hand in hand with the growth of a [[pan-Celticism|pan-Celtic]] or inter-Celtic dimension, seen in many organisations and festivals operating across various Celtic countries. Celtic studies departments at many universities in Europe and beyond, have studied the various ancient and modern Celtic languages and associated history and folklore under one roof.

The [[roots revival]], applied to [[Celtic music]], has brought much inter-Celtic cross-fertilisation, as, for instance, Welsh musicians have revived the use of the mediaeval Welsh [[bagpipe]] under the influence of the Breton ''binioù'', Irish ''uillean'' pipes and famous Scottish pipes, or the Scots have revived the ''bodhran'' from Irish influence. Sports such as [[Hurling]], [[Gaelic Football]] and [[Shinty]] are seen as being 'Celtic', whilst the Scottish [[mod (Scotland)|mod]] and Irish [[fleadh]] are seen as an equivalent to the Breton [[fest noz]].

The [[United States|USA]] has also taken part in discussions of modern Celticity. For example, recently elected [[Virginia]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[James H. Webb]], in his 2004 book ''Born Fighting &ndash; How the Scots-Irish Shaped America'', controversially asserts that the early ""pioneering"" immigrants to [[North America]] were of [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] origins. He goes on to argue that their distinct ""Celtic traits"" (loyalty to kin, mistrust of governmental authority, and military readiness), in contrast to the ""[[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]]"" settlers, helped construct the modern ""American identity"".  [[Irish American]]s also played an important role in the shaping of 19th-century [[Irish republicanism]] through the [[Fenian]] movement, the development of a discourse of the [[Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849)|Great Hunger]] as a British atrocity, and so on.

==Celtic nations==
[[Image:Celtic Nations.svg|right|thumb|175px|The '''Six Nations''']]
{{Main|Celtic nations}}
Six [[nation]]s tend to be most associated with a modern Celtic identity, and are considered 'the Celtic nations'. These are:

:* {{flag|Brittany}}
:* {{noflag}} [[Ireland]] (includes {{flag|Ireland}} and {{noflag}} [[Northern Ireland]])
:* {{flag|Scotland}}
:* {{flag|Wales}}
:* {{flag|Cornwall}}
:* {{flag|Isle of Man}}

It is these 'Six Nations' that (alone) are considered Celtic by the [[Celtic League (political organisation)|Celtic League]] and the [[Celtic Congress]] amongst others. These organisations ascribe to a definition of Celticity based mainly upon language. In the aforementioned six regions, Celtic languages have survived and continue to be used to varying degrees in Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Isle of Man, and Brittany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.breizh.net/icdbl/saozg/Celtic_Languages.pdf |title=Visio-Map of Europe Celtic Europe.vsd<!-- Bot generated title --> |date= |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-10-31}}</ref>

A number of activists on behalf of other regions/nations have also sought recognition as modern Celts, reflecting the wide diffusion of ancient Celts across Europe. Of these, the following regions are most prominent:

:*{{flag|Galicia}} (including Northern Portugal, once part of ancient Galicia or Gallaecia)
:*{{flag|Asturias}} (in the centre north of Spain) 

In neither Galicia / Northern Portugal nor Asturias has a Celtic language survived, and as such both fall outside of the [[Litmus test (politics)|litmus test]] used by the [[Celtic League (political organisation)|Celtic League]], and the [[Celtic Congress]]. Nevertheless, many organisations organised around Celticity consider that [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] / Northern Portugal ([[Douro]], [[Minho Province|Minho]] and [[Tras-os-Montes]]) and [[Asturias]]  ""can claim a Celtic cultural or historic heritage"".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.celticleague.org/celtic_nations.html |title=Celtic League American Branch - Celtic Nations |publisher=Celticleague.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-31}}</ref> These claims to Celticity are rooted in the long historical existence of Celts in these regions and ethnic connections to other Atlantic Celtic peoples<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol6/6_5/alvarez_sanchis_6_5.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - alvarez_sanchis_6_5.doc |date= |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol6/6_15/garcia_alonso_6_15.pdf |title=PaleoHispania<!-- Bot generated title --> |date= |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-10-31}}</ref> (see [[Celtiberians]], [[Celtici]] and [[Castro culture]]). 

Elements of Celtic music, dance, and folklore can be found within [[England]] (eg. [[Yan Tan Tethera]]), and the [[Cumbric language]] survived until the collapse of the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]] in about 1018.<ref>Fischer, S. R., ''History of Language'', Reaktion Books, 2004, p. 118</ref> England as a whole comprises many distinct regions, and some of these regions, such as [[Cumbria]],<ref>[http://www.celticcumbria.co.uk Page Title<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Lancashire]], Western [[Yorkshire]] and [[Devon]] {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}, claim more Celtic heritage than others. Notably, although modern Cumbria has similar borders to the older kingdom of [[Rheged]], it is an amalgation of [[Cumberland]], [[Westmorland]], [[Lancashire]] and part of the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], and many Cumbrians still identify first with these older counties{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}.<ref>http://www.barrowbc.gov.uk/pdf/Cumbria_Unitary_Bid_Critique_V3-web.pdf</ref>

==Migration from Celtic countries==
No treatment of modern Celticity would be complete without mentioning the migrations of people from Celtic countries. A very large portion of the populations of the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] is composed of people from Ireland, Britain, Brittany and the Isle of Man; and [[Jamaica]], [[South Africa]], [[Barbados]], [[Montserrat]], [[Saint-Barthélemy]], [[Venezuela]], [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], and [[Chile]] have also experienced large-scale migration from these lands at various times.

There are three areas outside Europe with communities of traditional Celtic language speakers: the province of [[Chubut Province|Chubut]] in [[Patagonia]] with Welsh-speaking [[Argentina|Argentinians]] (known as ''[[Welsh settlement in Argentina|Y Wladfa]]''), [[Cape Breton Island]] in [[Nova Scotia]] with [[Canadian Gaelic|Scottish Gaelic]]-speaking [[Canada|Canadians]], and southeast [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] with [[Irish language|Irish]]-speaking [[Canada|Canadians]].

While no Celtic-identified immigrant group is currently pursuing [[independence]] or other [[nationalist]] goals, Celtic-identified people have played critical roles in each societies' movements for independence from the larger [[empire]]s to which they were formerly attached – for example, the most common mother-tongue amongst the [[Fathers of Confederation]] which saw the formation of [[Canada]] was [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]].<ref>[http://www.pch.gc.ca/special/flag-drapeau/defi-challenge/reponses-answers_e.cfm Ministry of Canadian Heritage]. Gaelic most common mother-tongue among Fathers of Confederation. URL accessed 26/04/2006.</ref> Today, Celticity throughout the world is generally presented as a [[cultural]] identity (as opposed to [[nationalist]], but with a [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] or [[ethnic]] base), and is experiencing a major revival. There is a movement in [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]] for a separate province in Canada, as espoused by the [[Cape Breton Labour Party]] and others.

Since the 1960s, there has been a very considerable growth of interest and enthusiasm in their Celtic heritage on the part of such people. Certain areas outside of the identified Celtic nations have particularly strong associations with these various identities: the [[Yorke Peninsula]], [[South Australia]], with Cornish Australians; [[Liverpool]] and [[Manchester]] with the Welsh and Irish people in England; [[Jesus College, Oxford]] with Welsh students; [[South Boston|South]] [[Boston]] or the [[South Side Irish|South Side]] of [[Chicago]] with Irish Americans; and certain [[arrondissement]]s of [[Paris]] with Breton Parisians.

Simultaneously, in some former British colonies, or particular regions within them, the term [[Anglo-Celtic]] has emerged as a descriptor of an ethnic grouping. In particular, [[Anglo-Celtic Australian]] is a term commonly used in academic circles in Australia; it refers to at least 80% of the population.<ref>[http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/7d12b0f6763c78caca257061001cc588/af5129cb50e07099ca2570eb0082e462!OpenDocument Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2003, ""Population characteristics: Ancestry of Australia's population""] (from '''Australian Social Trends, 2003'''). Retrieved 1 September 2006.</ref> ""Anglo-Celtic"" can be interpreted as either an affirmation of both Celtic and Anglo-Saxon cultures, or a rejection of the notion that they are separate and distinct. It is not necessarily accepted by all of the people to which it is applied.

==Criticism of modern Celticism==
Many criticisms of modern Celticism tend to centre around the idea that the Modern Celts have little connection with the Ancient Celts and therefore are not entitled to use the name.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Furthermore, some historians also dispute the suitability of the term ""Celtic"" in the historic context.<ref name=James>{{cite web|url=http://www.le.ac.uk/ar/stj/alternative.htm|title=Simon James's Ancient Celts Page - An alternative history of 'Celticness'|accessdate=24 December 2009}}</ref>

[[John Collis]] of the [[University of Sheffield]] has argued that the idea of a 'Celtic' culture in the [[British Isles]] was invented entirely by early modern authors, primarily by [[Edward Lhuyd]], and then re-born by modern day nationalists. [[Simon James (archaeologist)|Simon James]] of the University of Leicester says that the Iron Age peoples of Britain should be considered not as generic Celts, but as a mosaic of different societies, each with their own traditions and histories.<ref name=James/> In Ireland, it has been argued that only around a quarter of the island contains significant archaeological evidence of the Iron Age culture typically identified as 'Celtic'.<ref>[http://www.irish-association.org/archives/richard_warner11_99.html CELTIC IRELAND AND OTHER FABLES: POLITICS AND PREHISTORY]</ref>  However, this line of reasoning has itself come under criticism, being labelled an intellectual extension of modern British cultural colonialism, as well as for simplifying the anthropological correlation between material culture and ethnicity. Ruth and Vincent Megaw attacked 'Celt-sceptics' for being motivated by [[English nationalism]] or anxieties about the decline of [[British Empire|British imperial power]]. Simon James wrote a response arguing that the rejection of a Celtic past was not 'nationalist' but partly due to new archaeological evidence, and partly motivated by a [[post-colonial]] and [[multiculturalist]] recognition that Britain has always been home to multiple identities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.le.ac.uk/ar/stj/furthread.htm|title=Simon James's Ancient Celts Page - Further info|accessdate=24 December 2009}}</ref>

Among [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic]] groups,  while there is strong evidence for linkages between Insular and [[Continental Celtic languages|Continental Celts]], earlier assumptions that the Atlantic Celts must be the descendants of an ""invasion"" of Continental Celts have largely been proven false. This finding has led some, including Richard Warner of the [[Ulster Museum]], to assert that the Atlantic Celts are ""not Celts at all"".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irish-association.org/archives/richard_warner11_99.html |title=The Irish Association - Richard Warner |publisher=Irish-association.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-31}}</ref>  Warner associates Celticity with a ""[[gene pool]]"" when he claims that ""the Celts"" were ""warrior-adventurers whose influence and effect far outweighed their numbers, but who are most unlikely to have a significant or measurable effect on the Irish gene pool"".

Despite this, many universities still maintain ""Departments of Celtic Studies"", including the [[University of Cambridge]] in England, which has a ""Department of
Anglo-Saxon, Norse and '''Celtic'''"".<ref>http://www.asnc.cam.ac.uk/</ref> [[Harvard University]] uses the title ""Department of Celtic ''languages and literatures''"", as a slight differentiation.<ref>http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~celtic/</ref> Three Scottish universities (The University of Glasgow<ref>http://www.gla.ac.uk/celtic/</ref>, The University of Edinburgh and the University of Aberdeen) have celtic departments through which students can study Scots Gaidhlig.

""'''1 Thing'''"" is a 2005 [[single (music)|single]] by [[United States|American]] [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] singer [[Amerie]]. The first single from Amerie's second album, ''[[Touch (Amerie album)|Touch]]'', and the only single from the soundtrack to the 2005 romantic comedy film ''[[Hitch (film)|Hitch]]'', ""1 Thing"" peaked at number eight in the United States and number four in the [[United Kingdom]], becoming Amerie's first top ten single and her biggest hit to date. The single was certified Platinum (200,000+ copies) by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] and earned Amerie a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for ""[[Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance|Best Female R&B Vocal Performance]]"" in [[Grammy Awards of 2006|2006]]. ""1 Thing"" was recently certified Gold by the RIAA for selling 500,000 in [[ring tone]]s.

==Song information==
""1 Thing"" was written by Amerie and [[Rich Harrison]] and is built around a [[sampling (music)|sample]] of [[The Meters]]' 1970 version of the same-titled theme song from ''[[Oh! Calcutta!]]'', written by Samuel Walden. Built around The Meters' [[funk]]y beat-driven percussion, ""1 Thing"" finds Amerie lamenting on an aspect of a relationship that keeps her satisfied. Even if other factors are less than positive, there is one thing that keeps her hooked (''""It's this one thing that's got me trippin...""'').

[[Image:Amerie2.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Amerie in the music video for ""1 Thing""]]
Although the song is Amerie's biggest hit to date, it was almost not released. In 2004, while working on her second album, Amerie enlisted the services of producer Rich Harrison, who had helped produce and write her first album. Harrison soon got to work and created a backing track from a loop of ""Oh, Calcutta!"", and presented it to Amerie. The singer was pleased with it, and the two immediately began to write melodies and lyrics for the song.

Despite a 2002 hit in ""[[Why Don't We Fall in Love]]"", Amerie was, at this time, relatively unestablished in the music industry. When Amerie's label, [[Sony BMG Music Entertainment|Sony]], heard ""1 Thing"", they felt its unusual sound was too risky for the singer, and decided to shelve it. Harrison tried to step in to vouch for the song; he had produced a similar-sounding hit, ""[[Crazy in Love (song)|Crazy in Love]]"", for [[Beyoncé Knowles|Beyoncé]], the year before, and hoped he could convince Sony to release the song based on the success of ""Crazy in Love"". Sony was unconvinced and refused to release the single.

After the song had been shelved for nearly a year and a half, Amerie began to get frustrated. There was talk of [[Jennifer Lopez]] taking the song for herself, and Amerie was not pleased, as she still felt her version had potential. In a final attempt to get the song released, Amerie and Harrison leaked the track to radio stations across the country. Immediately, the response was positive, and the track became an unofficial hit. A displeased Sony tried to repress the song, but the radio stations continued to play it. Lopez also was not thrilled, as she had wanted the song. However, radio refused to back down, and Sony finally relented in releasing ""1 Thing"" as a single. Lopez had to settle on another Harrison-produced, funk-infused track, ""[[Get Right]]"".

==The sound==
Despite being based on a Meters sample, the song belies a strong [[go-go]] influence. (Go-go is a funky, percussion-driven music indigenous to the [[Washington, D.C.]] area.) Amerie has said, ""If you're not from [[Maryland]], Washington, D.C., ([[Northern Virginia]]) area, you might not recognize the sound. The song is influenced by the style of music 'go go' which originated in Maryland, D.C., NoVA area in the late '70s and early '80s.""{{Fact|date=March 2007}} Perhaps because of the song's go-go vibe, ""1 Thing"" was extremely popular in the D.C./Baltimore area; it was the most played single in clubs there for fifteen weeks.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}

==Music video==
The [[music video]] of ""1 Thing"", directed by [[Chris Robinson (director)|Chris Robinson]] and Amerie, focuses on the singer's dance routines, featuring Amerie as a [[Go-Go dancing|Go-Go dancer]] in various setups, intercut with footage from the film ''Hitch''. In one scene, there is also black outlinings of the female dancers while they are dancing in red boxes behind Amerie. An alternate version of the video was created for the song's [[remix]], which features guest vocals from rapper [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]] (with [[Jay-Z]] featured on another version). A second remix features [[Fabolous]], while little-known [[Toronto]]nian producer Satya Rock has arranged an extended underground remix to feature [[E-40]], [[Method Man]], [[Lyrics Born]], [[One Be Lo]], Dres, [[Joe Budden]], [[Talib Kweli]],  [[Beanie Sigel]], [[Edan]], and [[Daniel Dumile|MF DOOM]].

'''Petter Furuseth''' (born 14 August 1978) is a Norwegian former professional [[association football|footballer]] who played as a [[midfielder]] in the top-flight in Norway, Sweden and Denmark. He is formerly knowns as '''Petter Furuseth Olsen'''. Furuseth represented Norway at youth international level

Furuseth started his career in the local club [[Eik-Tønsberg]], before he played for [[SK Brann|Brann]], [[Örebro SK|Örebro]], [[Hammarby IF|Hammarby]], [[Stabæk Fotball|Stabæk]], [[Viborg FF|Viborg]] and [[FC Midtjylland]]. Furuseth announced his retirement from football in August 2008, but made a comeback five months later in [[FK Lyn|Lyn]]. He later had spell with Swedish clubs [[Assyriska Föreningen|Assyriska]] and Hammarby, before he returned to Norway where he has been playing and coaching at amateur level.

'''Hurricane Camille''' was the third [[tropical cyclone]] and second hurricane of the [[1969 Atlantic hurricane season]]. At peak intensity, Camille was a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5]] hurricane that struck the [[United States]] near the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]] on the night of [[August 17]], causing catastrophic damage.  Camille was the only hurricane with official winds reported to reach at 190 mph until [[Hurricane Allen|Allen]] in [[1980]].

The storm formed on [[August 14]] and [[rapid deepening|rapidly deepened]]. It scraped the western edge of [[Cuba]] at category 3 intensity. Camille strengthened further over the Gulf of Mexico and made landfall with a pressure of 909&nbsp;[[mbar]] ([[hPa]]), estimated sustained winds of 190&nbsp;[[mph]] (305&nbsp;[[km/h]]), and a peak storm surge of 24 [[feet]] (7.3 [[m]]); it remains the strongest hurricane ever to strike the [[United States]] and one of the strongest tropical cyclone landfalls worldwide.  The hurricane flattened nearly everything along the coast of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Mississippi]], and caused additional flooding and deaths inland while crossing the [[Appalachian mountains]] of [[Virginia]].  In total, Camille killed 259 people and caused $1.42 billion (1969 [[USD]], $9.14 billion 2005 USD)

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Camille 1969 track.png}}
[[Image:Camille69.jpg|thumb|right|Camille in the Central Gulf of Mexico]]
A tropical wave left the coast of [[Africa]] on [[August 5]], becoming a tropical disturbance on [[August 9]], 480 miles east of the [[Leeward Islands]]. Aircraft reconnaisance identified a closed circulation in the disturbance on the 14th near [[Grand Cayman]] and the system was designated Tropical Storm Camille with 60 [[Miles per hour|mph]] (95 [[km/h]]) winds.

The storm already had a well organized circulation and rapidly strengthened from [[August 14]] to [[August 15]] to a 115 mph (185 km/h) major hurricane before hitting the western tip of [[Cuba]] later that day. Land interaction weakened Camille to a 100 mph (160 km/h) hurricane, but it returned to perfect conditions as it crossed the [[Gulf of Mexico]] (possibly while passing over the [[Loop Current]]). On [[August 17]], Camille reached an intense minimum central pressure of 905 [[mbar]] ([[hPa]]), and it continued to strengthen to a peak of over 190 mph (305 km/h) winds (possibly the strongest ever recorded in an [[Atlantic hurricane]]). In the hours before landfall, a reconnaissance aircraft was unable to obtain a surface wind report, but it estimated winds of up to <!--180 knots=205 mph=335 km/h-->205 mph (335 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 901 mbar (hPa).

[[Image:Camille1969.jpg|thumb|left|Camille nearing its final landfall]]
Camille crossed the southeastern tip of [[Louisiana]], and then hit near [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi]], on the night of [[August 17]]. Its [[Category 5]] strength winds are only estimated, due to the lack of wind reports near the center, though the NASA site at [[Picayune, Mississippi]], recorded an estimated gust of 160 mph with a pressure of 950 [[mbar]]. It maintained hurricane force winds for 10 hours as it moved 150 miles inland. As Camille turned east, its weakened to a tropical depression over northern [[Mississippi]] on the 19th. It picked up additional moisture from the Gulf Stream along the way and produced torrential rains in the remote mountains of [[Virginia]]. Camille turned eastward as it moved inland, and emerged into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] near [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]], on the 20th. The depression restrengthened over the [[Gulf Stream]], and briefly attained a peak of 70 mph (110 km/h) before becoming extratropical on the 22<sup>nd</sup>, east of [[Nova Scotia]].

==Impact==
{{Most intense US hurricanes|align=left}}
Making landfall as a Category 5 hurricane, Camille caused damage and destruction across much of the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]]. Because it moved quickly through the region, Hurricane Camille dropped only moderate precitipation in most areas. Most other areas reported from 1 to 6 inches.<ref name=""prelim"" /><!--Add some more here--> The area of total destruction in [[Harrison County, Mississippi]] was 68 [[square mile]]s (176 km²).<ref name=""harrison"">{{cite web|title=Harrison County Camille Information|url=http://www.harrison.lib.ms.us/library_services/camille.htm|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref> The total estimated cost of damage was $1.42 billion (1969 [[USD]], $9.14 billion 2005 USD).<ref name=""inflation"">{{cite web|title=The Inflation Calculator|url=http://www.westegg.com/inflation/|accessdate=2006-06-18}}</ref> This made Camille the second-most expensive hurricane in the United States, up to that point (behind [[Hurricane Betsy]]).<ref name=""cost"" /> The storm directly killed 143 people along [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Louisiana]]. An additional 153 people perished as a result of catastrophic flooding in [[Nelson County, Virginia]] and other areas nearby. In all, 8,931 people were injured, 5,662 homes were destroyed, and 13,915 homes experienced major damage, with many of the fatalities being coastal residents who had refused to evacuate.

===Gulf Coast and the Caribbean===
In the only [[Caribbean]] Island greatly affected by Camille, Cuba, three deaths were reported. Over 10 inches of rain were recorded in the western portion of Cuba.<ref name=""century"">{{cite web|title=Hurricane Camille; Storm of the Century|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ms3/n5ycn/camille.html|accessdate=2006-05-26}}</ref> But in continental North America, where Camille was stronger, more damage was brought. While moving over southeastern [[Louisiana]], the Weather Bureau Office at [[Boothville, Louisiana|Boothville]] reported wind gusts of 107 mph. At least $350 million (1969 USD, $1.85 billion 2005 USD)<ref name=""inflation"">{{cite web|title=The Inflation Calculator|url=http://www.westegg.com/inflation/|accessdate=2006-06-18}}</ref> in damage was reported.<ref name=""norisk""> {{cite web|title=New Orleans Hurricane Risk|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/ops/hurricane-risk-new-orleans.htm|accessdate=2006-05-26}}</ref> Alabama also experienced damage along U.S. Highway 90. 26,000 homes and over 1,000 businesses were wiped out completely across the state. Camille's large circulation also resulted in a 3 to 5 foot storm surge in [[Apalachicola, Florida]].
{{clr}}
[[Image:Camilleshipwrecks.jpg|thumb|right|Ships beached in [[Gulfport, Mississippi]]]]
[[Image:Wea02407.jpg|left|thumb|Damage from Camille]]
Mississippi received the worst of the damage. Upon making landfall, Camille produced a 24 foot storm surge. Mississsippi's entire shore and for some three to four blocks in, the destruction was nearly complete. The worst hit areas were [[Clermont Harbor]], [[Lakeshore]], [[Waveland]], Bay St. Louis, [[Pass Christian]], [[Long Beach]], and the beach front of [[Gulfport]], [[Mississippi City]], and [[Biloxi]]. More than 11 inches of rain occurred in [[Hancock County, Mississippi]], and most low-lying areas were flooded with up to 15 feet of water. [[U.S. Highway 90]], which is close to the shore, was broken up in many areas and sand and debris blocked much of it. Totals say that 3,800 homes and businesses were completely destroyed.

====The Hurricane Party====
One persistent legend about Camille states that a hurricane party was held on the third floor of the Richelieu Manor Apartments in [[Pass Christian, Mississippi]], in the path of the eyewall as it made landfall. The high storm surge flooded and destroyed the building, and there was only one survivor to tell of the story of the others. Who the survivor is, how many party guests there were, and just how far the sole survivor was swept by the storm varies with the retelling.
[[Image:Richeliu aptb.jpg|right|thumb|Richeliu Apartments before Camille]]
[[Image:Wea00423.jpg|left|thumb|A large, [[antebellum]] mansion destroyed by the high winds and storm surge.]]
In reality, most of the people that stayed in the Richelieu Apartments survived, but there is heavy debate on whether or not there was a party. Interviews from the local TV news station, WLOX, interviewed people who claimed to have stayed in the Richelieu Apartments. Among the survivors was the manager, who supposedly stayed in the Manager's Office while the party was going on. The wall of the office collapsed, causing water to come in. The manager claimed to have used a nearby object to stay afloat on the water until the storm receeded. Though other people have claimed that the residents, exhausted from preparing the town to weather the storm, took refuge in the building not out of recklessness, but because it was believed to be one of the sturdiest buildings in the area. Survivor Ben Duckworth is quoted in ''Hurricane Camille: Monster Storm of the Gulf Coast'' as stating that the Richelieu was a designated [[civil defense]] [[air-raid shelter]]. However, their faith in the building's sturdiness was unfounded, as it was completely demolished by the storm. Twenty-three people are known to have stayed in the Richelieu Apartments during the hurricane, of whom eight died.
[[Image:Richeliu apt.jpg|right|thumb|Richeliu Apartments After Camille]]
The tale of the lone survivor and the party appears to have originated with survivor Mary Ann Gerlach. Other survivors, including Duckworth and Richard Keller have expressed irritation at the story.<ref>{{cite web|title=UPM Philip Hearn Interview|url=http://www.upress.state.ms.us/features/camille/interview.html|publisher=University Press Mississippi|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Correcting the facts and debunking the myths of Camille|url=http://www.hurricanealley.net/camillemyth.htm|author=Kat Bergeron|publisher=The Sun Herald|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref> ""The hurricane party never happened, nor were the number of deaths associated with the apartment inhabitants accurate,"" says Pat Fitzpatrick, [[Mississippi State University]] professor and author of ''Hurricanes: A Reference Handbook''.<ref>{{cite web|title=""Hurricane Reference Guide|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20050330120739/http://www.ur.msstate.edu/news/stories/2004/hurricanebook.asp|publisher=Mississippi State University|accessdate=2005-03-30}}</ref>

===Ohio Valley and the Virginias===
Camille caused moderate rainfall in [[Tennessee]] and [[Kentucky]] of up to 5 inches, helping to relieve a drought in the area.<ref name=""prelim"" />

[[Image:Camilledamageva.jpg|thumb|left|The flooding of the James River]]
While moving through [[Virginia]] and [[West Virginia]], Camille dropped torrential rainfall of 12 to 20 inches, with one unofficial report of 31 inches. Most of the rainfall occurred in [[Virginia]] during a 3-5 hour period on [[August 20]].<ref name=""mrw"">{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/general/lib/lib1/nhclib/1969.pdf|title=1969 Monthly Weather Review|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]|format=PDF 17.8 MB|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref> The flooding led to overflown rivers in the 2 states, with the highest amounting being the [[James River]] in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] with a peak crest of 28.6 feet. Many rivers in Virginia and West Virginia set records for peak flood stages, causing numerous mudslides along mountainsides. In the mountain slopes between Charlottesville and Lynchburg, more than 10 inches of rain fell in a course of 12 mere hours. And in the same time, Nelson County recorded 27 inches of rain. Flooding was so catastrophic that all communications were cut off from the rest of the state. Because the hurricane was expected to quickly dissipate, few were prepared for the flash flooding.<ref name=""mrw"" /> The ensuing flash flood and mudslide killed 153 people. In [[Nelson County, Virginia|Nelson County]] alone, 133 bridges were washed out, while some entire communities were under water.<ref name=""prelim"" /> The major flooding that occurred downstream cut off all communications between Richmond and the Shenandoah Valley. Waynesboro on the South River saw eight feet of water downtown and Buena Vista had more than five feet. Throughout Virginia and West Virginia, Camille destroyed 349 houses, 83 trailers, 730 farm buildings, and 96 buildings. 4,128 familes were affected by the hurricane in the area, and total damage amounted to $140.8 million (1969 USD, $747 million 2005 USD).<ref name=""inflation"">{{cite web|title=The Inflation Calculator|url=http://www.westegg.com/inflation/|accessdate=2006-06-18}})</ref><ref name=""mrw"" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Virgina's Weather History|publisher=""Virginia Dept. of Emergency Management|url=http://www.vaemergency.com/newsroom/history/hurricane.cfm|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
The response after the storm involved many federal state and local agencies and volunteer organizations. The main organization for coordinating the federal response to the disaster was the Office of Emergency Preparedness which provided $76 million (1969 USD, $403 million 2005 USD)<ref name=""inflation"">{{cite web|title=The Inflation Calculator|url=http://www.westegg.com/inflation/|accessdate=2006-06-18}}</ref> to administer and coordinate disaster relief programs. Food and shelter were available the day after the storm. On [[August 19]] portions of Mississippi and Louisiana were declared major disaster areas and became eligible for federal disaster relief funds. <ref name=""thirty"">{{cite web|title=Thirty Years After Hurricane Camille: Lessons Learned, Lessons Lost|url=http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/about_us/meet_us/roger_pielke/camille/report.html|publisher=University of Colorado|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref>

Major organizations contributing to the relief effort included the Federal Power Commission which helped fully return power to affected areas by [[November 25]], [[2006]]. The Coast Guard(then under the Department of Transportation), Air force, Army, Army Corps of Engineers, Navy and Marine Corps all helped with evacuations, search and rescue, clearing debris and distribution of food. The Department of Defense contributed $34 million (1969 USD, $180 million 2005 USD)<ref name=""inflation"">{{cite web|title=The Inflation Calculator|url=http://www.westegg.com/inflation/|accessdate=2006-06-18}}</ref> and 16,500 military troops overall to the recovery. The Department of Health provided 4 million dollars towards medicine, vaccines and other health related needs. <ref name=""thirty"" />

Long term re-development was overseen by the Department of Commerce, which contributed $30 million (1969 USD, $159 million 2005 USD)<ref name=""inflation"">{{cite web|title=The Inflation Calculator|url=http://www.westegg.com/inflation/|accessdate=2006-06-18}}</ref> towards planned and coordinated redevelopment of affected areas. 

In a 1999 report on Hurricane Camille sponsored by the NOAA Coastal Services Center, the authors concluded: ""With Camille, the preparations for the event and the response were based on processes put in place long before the storm made landfall. Coordination between government agencies as well as with state and local officials was enhanced because of preexisting plans."" <ref name=""thirty"" />

==Comparisons to Hurricane Katrina==
Comparisons between [[Hurricane Katrina]] of the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005 season]] and Camille are inevitable because of their similar strengths and nearly identical landfall locations. Before Katrina, Camille was considered to be the ""benchmark"" against which all Gulf Coast hurricanes were measured. Katrina was weaker than Camille at landfall but substantially larger, which led to both a broader and a larger storm surge. Katrina was described by those that experienced Camille as ""much worse"" - not only because of the massive storm surge, but from the fact that Katrina pounded the Mississippi coast for a longer period of time. Camille also drew part of its record storm surge from adjacent coastal waters; [[Lake Borgne]] and [[Lake Pontchartrain]] actually receded, sparing the city of [[New Orleans]] from flooding.

Some locals argue that Katrina's death toll was made higher because those who survived Camille with no flooding and little damage believed Katrina to be less of a threat, creating a false sense of security among Camille veterans. An innkeeper at the Harbour Oaks Inn, [[Tony Brugger]], stayed at the inn and died when his inn collapsed.<ref name=clarion"">{{cite web|title=""Storm victim has no time to grieve""|publisher=The Clarion Ledger|url=http://www.clarionledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051121/NEWS0110/511210355/1002/NEWS01|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref> A popular rumor has Brugger telling a radio station during an interview that he wouldn't leave because since Camille's surge had not affected the inn, Katrina's would not either.

==Records and naming==
{{Most intense hurricanes|align=right}}
===Records===
Camille produced the seventh lowest official barometric pressure ever recorded in the Atlantic basin, a scant 905 mbar; the only hurricane to hit the United States with a lower pressure at landfall was the [[Labor Day Hurricane of 1935]]. A reconissance flight indicated a pressure of 901 mbar,<ref name=""srh"">{{cite web|title=NWS Jackson Special Weather Summary|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jan/msnws8.html|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref> but this pressure was not verified, and remains unofficial pending reanalysis. The wind speed of Camille can only be approximated, as no meteorogical equipment survived the extreme conditions at landfall, but Camille is estimated to have had sustained winds of 190 mph (305 km/h) at landfall, with gusts exceeding 210 mph (340 km/h).<ref name=""srh"" /> Before [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, Camille likely had the highest [[storm surge]] measured in the United States, at over 24 [[feet]] (7.3 [[meters]]).<ref name=""army"">{{cite web|title=Hurricane Resources|url=http://www.hq.usace.army.mil/history/Hurricane_files/Hurricane.htm|publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref>

The 24-foot storm surge quoted by the Army Corps of Engineers was based on high water marks inside surviving buildings, of which there were but three.  Prior to the collapse of the Richelieu Apartments, Ben Duckworth shined a flashlight down a stairwell and found the water within one step of the third-story floor; this establishes a surge height of 28 feet at that spot at that time.  About 15 minutes later, the building collapsed and the evidence vanished with it.

In addition, Camille forced the Mississippi River to flow backwards for a river-distance of 125 miles (from its mouth to a point north of New Orleans).  The river further backed up for an additional 120 miles, to a point north of Baton Rouge.<ref name=""cat5book"">{{cite book|first=Judith A|last=Howard|title=Category 5 : The Story of Camille|id=ISBN 0472115251|publisher=University of Michigan Press|pages=109}}</ref>

===Naming===
In 1969 the naming conventions for hurricanes were not strictly controlled as they are today.  There were only three requirements: the name had to be female (male names were not used at that time), the names had to remain in alphabetical order, and the name could not have been retired. [[John Hope (meteorologist)|John Hope]], a [[meteorology|meteorologist]] at the [[National Hurricane Center]] had a daughter who had just graduated from high school. He added her name &mdash; Camille &mdash; to the list of storm names for the year, having no way of knowing that the storm bearing her name would become infamous.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ngeorgia.com/people/hope.html|title=John Hope a North Georgia Notable|publisher=Golden Ink|accessdate=2006-05-29}}</ref>

===Retirement===
{{seealso|List of retired Atlantic hurricanes}}
The name was retired after the 1969 season due to the major destruction and death in much of the Southern United States.

'''William Alexander ""Bill"" Lange''' ({{pron-en|ˈlæŋ}})<ref name=""dictionary"">{{cite web| title = Lange entry from Dictionary.com | publisher = dictionary.com | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Lange | accessdate = 2008-08-14}}</ref> (June 6, 1871&nbsp;– July 23, 1950), also known as ""Little Eva"",<ref name=""robbins194"">Robbins, p. 194</ref> was an American [[Major League Baseball]] [[center fielder]], who played his entire seven year career for the [[Chicago Cubs|Chicago Colts and Orphans]] from {{by|1893}} to {{by|1899}}.  During his time in the Majors, he once led the [[National League]] in [[stolen base]]s, and was among the seasonal leaders in several other offensive categories including [[home run]]s, and [[batting average]].

Lange was noted for having a combination of great speed and power, especially for his size. His {{convert|6|ft|1|in|m|adj=on}}, {{convert|190|lb|kg|adj=on}} frame was considered large for his era.<ref name=""snyder101"">Snyder, p. 101</ref>  He is best known for retiring from baseball during the prime of his career to get married, as his future father-in-law forbade his daughter to marry a baseball player.  Despite the short-lived marriage, he refused all offers to return as a player.

He became a successful [[Businessperson|businessman]] after his retirement from baseball.  In addition to his success in [[real estate]] and [[insurance]], he became a leading figure in Major League Baseball's efforts to generate interest in the game worldwide.  He was enlisted by the leading baseball figures of the day to assist in establishing leagues in several European countries, that could eventually compete against American teams, while also [[Scout (sport)|scouting]] for undiscovered talent.

==Early life==
Born in the [[Presidio of San Francisco|Presidio District]]<ref name=""nelson51"">Nelson, p. 51</ref> of [[San Francisco, California]],<ref name=""retrosheet"">{{cite web| title = Bill Lange's career stats | publisher = retrosheet.org | url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/L/Plangb102.htm | accessdate = 2008-07-28}}</ref>, he ran away from home while still in [[grammar school]] to live with his brother in [[Port Townsend, Washington]].<ref name=nelson51/>  It was from there that he moved up to play [[Minor League Baseball]] for the Seattle Reds of the Northwestern Baseball League in the early 1890s.<ref name=""seattle"">{{cite web|last=Raley|first=Dan|title = From Reds to Ruth to Rainiers: City's history has its hits, misses | publisher= ''[[Seattle Post]]''|date= 1999-07-04| url=http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/safeco/game/oldbp.shtml | accessdate = 2008-07-28}}</ref>  When the Northwestern League folded, Lange return the Bay area to play for the Oakland Colonels of the California League.<ref name=""nelson52"">Nelson, p. 52</ref>  He played one season for the Colonels, then was signed by the [[Chicago Cubs|Chicago Colts]] of the [[National League]].<ref name=nelson52/>

==Major League career==
Lange made his Major League debut on April 27, {{by|1893}} for the Colts, and enjoyed a successful inaugural Major League season.  He scored 92&nbsp;[[run scored|times]], hit eight [[home run]]s, had 88 [[run batted in|runs batted in]] (RBIs), while also finishing seventh in [[stolen base]]s with 47, and [[Batting average#Baseball|batted .281]].  This was the only time he batted under .300 during his Major League career.<ref name=""reference"">{{cite web| title = Bill Lange's career stats | work = [[baseball-reference.com]] | url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/l/langebi01.shtml | accessdate = 2008-08-05}}</ref>  In the field that season, he played at [[second baseman|second base]], in [[right fielder|right field]] and [[center field]].  He did not start playing center field exclusively until the following season.<ref name=retrosheet/>  Lange continued his success in {{by|1894}} by raising his batting average to .328 and finishing fifth in the league with 65&nbsp;stolen bases.<ref name=reference/>

Lange achieved his highest league rankings in {{by|1895}}. His .389&nbsp;batting average was fifth in the league<ref name=reference/> and is still the top individual season average in Chicago Cubs's history.<ref name=""snyder86"">Snyder, p. 86</ref>  He also finished second in the league in stolen bases with 67, fifth in home runs with 10, fifth in [[on-base percentage]] with .456, hit 16&nbsp;[[triple (baseball)|triples]], scored 120&nbsp;runs, and batted in 98&nbsp;RBIs.<ref name=reference/>

Lange had several notable moments during the {{by|1896}} season.  On July 4, he stole five bases in one game against the [[Louisville Colonels]]<ref name=""snyder89"">Snyder, p. 89</ref>, although it was two stolen bases short of the record of seven set by [[George Gore]] and [[Billy Hamilton (baseball)|Billy Hamilton]].<ref name=""stolenbases"">{{cite web| title = Stolen Bases Records | work = baseball-almanac.com | url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/recbooks/rb_stba.shtml | accessdate = 2008-08-19}}</ref>  During a game on August 31, he entered baseball lore with a feat that he never actually performed.  The game was scoreless in the bottom of the 10th [[innings|inning]] when Lange made a diving catch in center field to keep the game scoreless.  Later in the inning, Chicago's [[first baseman]], [[George Decker (baseball)|George Decker]] attempted to field a thrown ball from third baseman [[Barry McCormick]], but it bounced off and broke his wrist instead.  In an effort to get Decker to the [[hospital]] adjacent the [[Baseball park|ballpark]], his teammates knocked down several wooden slats of the outfield [[fence]] to expedite his journey.  However, the two events were confused and it became legend that Lange had crashed through the fence making that acrobatic catch in tenth.<ref name=""snyder90"">Snyder, p. 90</ref>  Lange finished the season with a .326&nbsp;batting average, while also stealing 84&nbsp;bases, second in the league, and finished eighth in league with 16&nbsp;triples.<ref name=reference/>

His success continued into the {{by|1897}} season, as he batted .340, scored 119&nbsp;runs, and led the league in stolen bases for the only time in his career.<ref name=reference/>  His production dropped his last two seasons in the Majors as his runs scored fell to 79 in {{by|1898}} and 81 in {{by|1899}}, although he still kept his batting averages of .319 and .325 respectively.<ref name=retrosheet/>

While he was very popular, his career as a baseball player was not without controversy.  He was ejected from a game on at least two occasions,<ref name=retrosheet/> one of which occurred on May 23, {{by|1897}} when he had an on-field fight with [[Washington Senators (1891-1899)|Washington Senators]] second baseman [[John O'Brien (second baseman)|John O'Brien]].<ref name=""snyder91"">Snyder, p. 91</ref>  On September 16, 1899, in a game against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn Superbas]], [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]] [[Ed Swartwood]] called the game because of darkness with Brooklyn up by two runs.  Lange, and other Chicago player surrounded Swartwood and proceeded to ""knock him around"", with Lange notably ""tweaking"" the umpire's ear.<ref name=""seymour198"">Snyder, p. 198</ref>

==Retirement==
Lange finished his career on October 15, 1899, having announced a few days earlier his intention to retire after the season. His team played a [[Doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]] that day, winning 7&ndash;0 against the [[St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis Perfectos]], then losing to the Louisville Colonels later that day in a game shortened by darkness.<ref name=snyder101/>

He retired from the game at age 28, during the prime of his career, so he could marry a woman whose father forbade her to marry a baseball player.<ref name=snyder101/> In the eyes of the 19th century public, baseball players were popular, but were often looked upon as low class. Lange's future wife was from his hometown of San Francisco, and her family was very well-to-do. Also, with the prospect of entering into the world of real estate and insurance, he could make much more money than he did as a ball player.<ref name=""nelson56"">Nelson, p. 56</ref> Though the marriage ended in a divorce a short time later,<ref name=snyder101/> he would not take any offers to return to Major League Baseball, despite Chicago's salary offer of $3,500 that would have made him the highest paid player in the league.<ref name=nelson56/>  Although his career lasted only seven years, he finished as the decade leader among 1890s Chicago players in batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and stolen bases.<ref name=""snyder64"">Snyder, p. 64</ref>

==Post-career==
Lange became successful in both [[real estate]] and [[insurance]] in his hometown of San Francisco after he retired from baseball.<ref name=""europe"">{{cite web|title = Plan World-Wide League |publisher = ''[[The New York Times]]''|date=1919-01-19| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=950DE6D61339E13ABC4152DFB7668382609EDE | accessdate = 2008-07-28}}</ref>  Lange is also credited in several sources, as being the person who discovered future Chicago Cubs [[first baseman]], [[manager (baseball)|manager]], and [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famer]], [[Frank Chance]], after having watched him play for the local [[Fresno, California]] team during the off-season of 1897.<ref name=""bioprojectchance"">{{cite web| title = The Biography Project: Frank Chance | publisher= by Gregory Ryhal, bioproj.sabr.org | url=http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&v=l&pid=2327&bid=904 | accessdate = 2008-07-29}}</ref>  Lange had recommended Chance to the team owner, [[Jim Hart (baseball)|Jim Hart]], but Hart disputed this claim, saying that Henry Harris had recommended Chance to him while Harris was an owner of a San Francisco team in the fall of 1897.<ref name=""simon91"">Simon, p. 91</ref>

In {{by|1907}}, the California State League, a minor league, was declared by organized baseball to be an ""outlaw"" league.  Organized baseball accused the league of harboring players from the Majors Leagues who had violated the [[reserve clause]] to join a number of their teams.<ref name=seymour198/>  The league had become a rival to the already established [[Pacific Coast League]] (PCL), who, after being an ""outlaw"" league themselves, had signed the National Agreement with organized baseball, agreeing that they would not harbor blacklisted or banned players from the Major Leagues.<ref name=seymour198/> A national commission decided that the best way to deal with this situation was to dissolve this outlaw league.  They did this by lifting the blacklist on any player already in the State League, which would create competition among all known leagues, for these players.  This commission enlisted Lange, who used his influence with the sports editors in the local area to speed up the process.  The attempt worked as the PCL successfully lured the [[Sacramento, California]] team into joining their league, with many of the players soon to follow.<ref name=seymour198/>

Later, [[John McGraw]] of the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] enlisted Lange as his chief European baseball [[Scout (sport)|scout]], hoping to discover any hidden talent in that untapped market.  In {{by|1919}}, [[Ban Johnson]], the [[American League]] president enlisted Lange as his chief organizer of baseball teams in Europe, mainly in England, France, [[Belgium]], and Italy.<ref name=europe/>  Johnson's plan was for Lange to evaluate talent and establish an International Baseball League that could compete against the [[American League]] [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]] winning team in an effort to generate greater interest in the game.<ref name=europe/>  Lange became part of the board of directors at the [[YMCA]], which helped fund the expedition.  Additionally, [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]] owner [[Clark Griffith]] donated $40,000 worth of equipment to assist in supplying the new league.

Lange died at the age of 79 in his hometown of San Francisco, and is interred at the [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Colma|Holy Cross Cemetery]] in [[Colma, California]].<ref name=retrosheet/>  Two of his nephews played Major League ball as well, [[Ren Kelly|Ren]], and [[George Kelly (baseball)|George ""Highpockets"" Kelly]].<ref name=retrosheet/><ref name=""praise"">{{cite web| title = Bill Lange Praises Hoyt |publisher = ''[[The New York Times]]''|date=1921-10-13| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E0CE5DB1431EF33A25750C1A9669D946095D6CF | accessdate = 2008-07-29}}</ref>  George later gained induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame in {{by|1973}}.<ref name=""georgekelly"">{{cite web| title = Highpockets Kelly's stats | publisher= retrosheet.org | url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/K/Pkellg101.htm | accessdate = 2008-07-29}}</ref>

'''Nikolai Alexandrovich Kulikovsky''' ({{lang-ru|Николай Александрович Куликовский}}; 5 November 1881<!--Old Style date--> – 11 August 1958) was the second husband of [[Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia]], the sister of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] and daughter of [[Alexander III of Russia|Tsar Alexander III]].

He was born into a military landowning family from the south of the [[Russian Empire]], and followed the family tradition by entering the army. In 1903, he was noticed by Grand Duchess Olga during a military review, and they became close friends. Olga wanted to divorce her first husband, [[Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg]], and marry Kulikovsky, but neither her husband nor her brother, the Tsar, would allow it.

During [[World War I]], Olga eventually obtained a divorce and married Kulikovsky. They had two sons. Her brother was deposed in the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], and Kulikovsky was dismissed from the army by the revolutionary government. The Kulikovskys were forced into exile, and he became a farmer and businessman in Denmark, where they lived until after [[World War II]]. In 1948, they emigrated to Canada as agricultural immigrants, but within four years of their arrival they had sold their farm and moved into a small suburban house. He became increasingly disabled by back pain, and died in 1958 aged 76.

==Early life==
Nikolai Kulikovsky was born into a military family from the [[Voronezh Oblast|Voronezh province]] of Russia. His grandfather was a general during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and his family owned two large estates in the [[Ukraine]]. He rode from an early age, became an expert horseman, and was educated at Petrograd Real College of Gurevich, followed by the Nikolai Cavalry College, from where he graduated with a degree.<ref name=p63>Phenix, p. 63</ref>

He joined the Blue [[Cuirassier]] regiment of the [[imperial Russia]]n cavalry shortly before 1903. [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Michael]], the younger brother of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]], was the regiment's honorary colonel. In April 1903, during a military parade at the [[Pavlovsk Palace]], Grand Duchess Olga, the youngest sister of Nicholas and Michael, saw Kulikovsky and begged Michael to arrange the seating at a casual luncheon so that she and Kulikovsky were adjacent.<ref>Phenix, p. 62</ref> The Grand Duchess was already married to [[Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg]], who was covertly believed by his friends and family to be homosexual.<ref>Phenix, p. 52</ref> A few days after her brief meeting with Kulikovsky, Olga asked Oldenburg for a divorce, which he refused with the qualification that he would reconsider his decision after seven years.<ref name=p63/>

Kulikovsky was appointed as captain in the Blue Cuirassiers and posted to the provinces. By 1906, he and Olga were corresponding regularly,<ref>Phenix, p. 71</ref> when Olga's husband Duke Peter appointed Kulikovsky as his [[aide-de-camp]]. With Peter's permission, Kulikovsky moved into the 200-room residence in Sergievskaya Street, [[Saint Petersburg]], that Peter shared with Olga.<ref>Phenix, p. 73; Vorres, pp. 94–95</ref> According to a fellow officer, gossip about a possible romance between Kulikovsky and the Grand Duchess, based on little more than their holding hands in public, spread through high society.<ref>''A Cuirassier's Memoirs'' by Vladimir Trubetskoy, quoted in Phenix, p. 73</ref>

==Marriage and revolution==
[[File:Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Black-and-white photograph of a young Olga seated in an Edwardian dress with a high neck line and long sleeves. Her thick dark hair is pinned up, and she wears a rope of pearls around her neck.|Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna]]
Though Olga repeatedly asked [[Tsar Nicholas II]] to allow her to divorce, her brother refused on religious and dynastic grounds; he believed marriage was for life and that royalty should marry within royalty. When their brother, Grand Duke Michael, eloped with his mistress, [[Natalia Brassova|Natasha Wulfert]], the Tsar and Olga were scandalized along with the rest of society. Natasha was a commoner who had been divorced twice, and one of her former husbands was an officer in the same regiment as Kulikovsky.<ref>Phenix, pp. 85–86; Vorres, p. 108</ref> Michael was banished from Russia, and the likelihood of the Tsar ever granting Olga's divorce, or permitting her to marry a commoner, looked remote.<ref>Phenix, pp. 85–86</ref>

At the outbreak of [[World War I]], Kulikovsky was sent to the front with his regiment. Michael was recalled from abroad, and Olga went to work in a military hospital as a nurse. Olga continued to press the Tsar to allow her divorce. In a letter she wrote, ""...finish with the divorce now during the war while all eyes and minds are occupied elsewhere—and such a small thing would be lost in all the greater things"".<ref>Letter from Grand Duchess Olga to Tsar Nicholas II, 16 May 1916, State Archive of the Russian Federation, 643 28, quoted in Phenix, p. 97</ref> The war went badly for the Russian imperial forces, and the [[Central Powers]], led by Germany, advanced into Russia. Fearful for Kulikovsky's safety, Olga pleaded with the Tsar to transfer him to the relative safety of [[Kiev]], where she was stationed at a hospital.<ref>Letter from Grand Duchess Olga to Tsar Nicholas II, 18 June 1916, State Archive of the Russian Federation, 601 1316, quoted in Phenix, p. 98</ref> In 1916, after visiting her in Kiev, the Tsar officially annulled her marriage to Duke Peter, and she married Kulikovsky on 16 November 1916,<!--New Style date--> in the Kievo-Vasilievskaya Church on Triokhsviatitelskaya (Three Saints Street) in Kiev.<ref>Phenix, p. 103</ref> Only the officiating priest, Olga's mother the [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Dowager Empress Marie]], Olga's brother-in-law [[Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia|Grand Duke Alexander]], two fellow nurses from the hospital in Kiev and four officers of the Akhtyrsky regiment, of which Olga was honorary colonel, attended.<ref>Grand Duke Alexander's Memoirs, ''Once A Grand Duke'', p. 273, quoted in Phenix, p. 104</ref> Their two-week honeymoon was spent in a farmhouse in Podgorny that had belonged to family friends of the Kulikovskys.<ref>Phenix, p. 105</ref> After visiting Kulikovsky's parents and grandmother in [[Kharkov]], Olga and Kulikovsky returned to Kiev.<ref>Phenix, p. 106</ref>

During the war, internal tensions and economic deprivation in Russia continued to mount and revolutionary sympathies grew. After Nicholas II was deposed in early 1917, many members of the Romanov dynasty, including Nicholas and his immediate family, were held under house arrest. The new government retired Kulikovsky from the army with the rank of lieutenant-colonel.<ref>Phenix, p. 115</ref> Dowager Empress Marie, Grand Duke Alexander, Grand Duchess Olga, and Kulikovsky managed to escape to the [[Crimea]] where they lived for a time before they too were placed under house arrest at one of the imperial estates.<ref>Phenix, pp. 115–118; Vorres, pp. 149-153</ref> As a commoner, Kulikovsky was permitted more freedom of movement than the Romanovs, and was occasionally able to leave the estate in a pony-cart, which allowed him to run errands, obtain food, and seek news of the outside.<ref>Vorres, p. 153</ref> On 12 August 1917, Olga and Kulikovsky's first child and son, Tikhon, was born in the Crimea. He was named after one of the Grand Duchess's favorite saints, [[Tikhon of Zadonsk]].<ref>Phenix, pp. 57–58, 119</ref> Although the grandson of an emperor and the nephew of another, Tikhon received no titles because his father was a commoner.<ref>[[Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire]], 23 April 1906, section 2, chapters 3 and 5</ref>

As newspapers were banned and letters infrequent, the Romanovs under house arrest knew little of the fate of Tsar Nicholas and his family. Nicholas, [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|his wife]], and their children, were originally held at their official residence, the [[Alexander Palace]], but the provisional government under [[Alexander Fyodorovich Kerensky]] relocated them to [[Tobolsk]], [[Siberia]].<ref>Phenix, p. 119</ref> Eventually, in July 1918, Nicholas and his family were killed by their [[Bolshevik]] guards. In the Crimea, the Grand Duchess's family were condemned to death by the [[Yalta]] revolutionary council but the executions were stayed by the [[Sevastopol]] council, who refused to act without orders from Moscow.<ref>Phenix, p. 122; Vorres, pp. 155–156; Zeepvat, p. 152</ref> In March 1918, German forces advanced on the Crimea, and the revolutionary guards were replaced by German ones.<ref>Phenix, pp. 123–125; Vorres, pp. 156–157</ref>

When Germany surrendered to the [[Allies of World War I]] in November 1918, the German troops evacuated, allowing the surviving members of the imperial family time to escape abroad. The British warship [[HMS Marlborough (1912)|HMS ''Marlborough'']] rescued the Dowager Empress Marie and some of her family from the Crimea but Grand Duchess Olga and Kulikovsky decided to stay in Russia and travelled to the Caucasus region, where the Bolsheviks had been pushed back by the [[White Army]].<ref>Phenix, p. 128; Vorres, p. 159</ref> During the journey, a coupling on the train carriage in which they were travelling developed a fault, possibly from sabotage, and Kulikovsky crawled over the carriage roofs to reach the driver and stop the train.<ref>Vorres, p. 160</ref> In the Caucasus, Kulikovsky took a job working on a farm as he was unable to secure a military posting in the White Army because the commanding general, [[Anton Denikin]], wished to avoid association with the Romanovs.<ref>Vorres, pp. 160–162</ref> In a rented farmhouse at the large [[Cossack]] village of Novominskaya Olga and Kulikovsky's second son, Guri, was born on 23 April 1919. He was named after Guri Panaev, who had been killed serving in Olga's Akhtyrsky regiment. As the White Army was pushed back and the [[Red Army]] approached, the family set out on what would be their last journey through Russia; they travelled to [[Rostov-on-Don]], and from there took refuge in the residence of the Danish consul at [[Novorossiysk]], Thomas Schytte,<ref>Phenix, pp. 130–131; Vorres, pp. 160–163</ref> who informed them of Dowager Empress Marie's safe arrival in [[Denmark]].<ref>[http://history-gatchina.ru/owners/olga/olga5e.htm Kulikovsky-Romanoff, p. 5]</ref>

After a brief stay with the Danish consul, the family were shipped to a refugee camp on the island of [[Büyükada]] in the [[Dardanelles]] Strait near [[Istanbul, Turkey]], where the Kulikovsky family shared three rooms with eleven other adults.<ref>Phenix, p. 132</ref> After two weeks, they were evacuated to [[Belgrade]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], later [[Yugoslavia]]. The Yugoslav Regent Alexander Karageorgevich, later to become King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I]], offered them a permanent home there, but Dowager Empress Marie summoned her daughter to Denmark.<ref>Phenix, pp. 132–134; Vorres, p. 165</ref> The Grand Duchess complied, and the family arrived in Copenhagen on Good Friday 1920. They lived with Kulikovsky's mother-in-law, Dowager Empress Marie, at first at the [[Amalienborg Palace]] and then at the royal estate of [[Hvidøre]]. Kulikovsky and Marie did not get along; he resented his wife acting as Marie's secretary and companion,<ref>Phenix, p. 135</ref> and Marie was distant toward him.<ref>Phenix, p. 134; Vorres, p. 172</ref>

==Danish residency and exodus==
Without a role or rank, Kulikovsky brooded in Denmark, becoming moody and listless.<ref>Phenix, p. 138</ref> A spinal injury sustained during the war, for which he had to wear a corset, remained unhealed.<ref name=p168>Phenix, p. 168</ref> In 1925, Kulikovsky accompanied his wife to a Berlin nursing home to meet [[Anna Anderson]], who claimed to be Olga's niece, [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia]]. According to [[Harriet von Rathlef]], who witnessed the meeting, while Olga and Anderson conversed, he sat in a corner and sulked.<ref>Kurth, p. 112</ref> Although Olga felt sympathy for Anderson, if only because she was ill, she eventually denounced her as an impostor. Possibly, she was pressured to do so by Kulikovsky and Dowager Empress Marie.<ref>Phenix, p. 155</ref>

Marie died on 13 October 1928, and the Kulikovskys moved out of Hvidøre. After a brief stay in the Amalienborg Palace, the Kulikovskys moved to [[Holte]], near [[Klampenborg]],<ref name=p168/> where a Danish millionaire, Gorm Rasmussen, engaged Kulikovsky to manage his stables.<ref>Vorres, pp. 184–185</ref> Hvidøre and some of Marie's jewellery were sold. With Olga's inheritance, Kulikovsky and his family were able to purchase ''Knudsminde'' Farm, several miles outside of [[Copenhagen]]. Kulikovsky was appointed to the board of a Russian insurance company based in Copenhagen, and oversaw the running of the farm.<ref name=p168/> The farm-estate became a center for the Russian monarchist and anti-Bolshevik community in Denmark.<ref>Phenix, p. 170</ref>

On 9 April 1940, neutral Denmark was invaded by [[Nazi Germany]] and was occupied for the rest of [[World War II]]. As Olga's sons, Tikhon and Guri, served as officers in the [[Danish Army]], they were interned as prisoners of war, but their imprisonment in a Copenhagen hotel lasted less than two months.<ref>Phenix, p. 174</ref> Other Russian émigrés, keen to fight against the Soviets, enlisted in the German forces. Despite her sons' internment and her mother's Danish origins, Olga was implicated in her compatriots' collusion with German forces, as she continued to meet and extend help to Russian émigrés fighting against communism.<ref>Phenix, p. 176; Vorres, p. 187</ref> After the surrender of Germany in 1945, the [[Soviet Union]] wrote to the Danish government accusing the Grand Duchess of conspiracy against the Soviet authorities.<ref>Phenix, p. 179</ref> With the end of the war, Soviet troops came close to the border of Denmark, and Olga grew fearful of an assassination or kidnap attempt.<ref>Phenix, pp. 179–180; Vorres, pp. 187–188</ref> She decided to move her family across the Atlantic to the relative safety of rural Canada,<ref>Mr. J. S. P. Armstrong, Agent General for Ontario, quoted in Vorres, p. 191</ref> a decision with which Kulikovsky complied.<ref>Phenix, p. 184; Vorres, p. 191</ref>

==Later life==
In May 1948, the Kulikovskys travelled to London by Danish troopship. They were housed in a [[grace-and-favour]] apartment at [[Hampton Court Palace]] while arrangements were made for their journey to Canada as agricultural immigrants.<ref>Vorres, pp. 188, 190</ref> On 2 June 1948, Kulikovsky, Olga, Tikhon and his Danish-born wife Agnete, Guli and his Danish-born wife Ruth, Guli and Ruth's two children, Xenia and Leonid, and Olga's companion and former maid Emilia Tenso (""Mimka"") departed [[Liverpool]] on board the ''[[RMS Empress of Canada (1928)|Empress of Canada]]''.<ref>Vorres, p. 193</ref> After a rough crossing, the ship docked at [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]].<ref>Vorres, p. 196</ref> The family proceeded to [[Toronto]], where they lived until they purchased a 200-acre (0.8&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) farm in [[Halton County, Ontario]], near [[Campbellville, Ontario|Campbellville]].<ref>Vorres, pp. 196–198</ref> Kulikovsky was relieved to move out of Toronto, and escape media attention.<ref>Phenix, p. 193</ref>

By 1952, the farm had become a burden to the elderly couple. Their sons had moved away; labour was hard to come by; Kulikovsky suffered increasing back pain and disability, and some of Olga's remaining jewellery was stolen.<ref>Vorres, pp. 207–208</ref> The farm was sold, and Kulikovsky, Olga, and Mimka, moved to a smaller 5-room house at 2130 Camilla Road, [[Cooksville, Ontario]], a suburb of Toronto (now amalgamated into the city of [[Mississauga]]).<ref>Phenix, pp. 205–206; Vorres, p. 209</ref> Mimka suffered a stroke that left her an invalid, and Olga nursed her until Mimka's death in 1954.<ref>Phenix, p. 207; Vorres, p. 210</ref> Neighbours and visitors to the region, including foreign and royal dignitaries, took interest in Olga as the ""last Romanov"", and visited their small home, which was also a magnet for [[Romanov impostors]] whom both Kulikovsky and Olga considered a menace.<ref>Vorres, pp. 200–205</ref> Welcome visitors included [[Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent]], the daughter of [[Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia]], in 1954,<ref>Phenix, p. 214; Vorres, p. 211</ref> and [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma]], and his wife, [[Edwina Mountbatten, Countess Mountbatten of Burma|Edwina]], in August 1959.<ref>Vorres, p. 221</ref>

By 1952, Kulikovsky had shrunk more than 4&nbsp;inches (10&nbsp;cm) from his peak height of 6&nbsp;ft 2&nbsp;inches (188&nbsp;cm). He distrusted conventional medicine and tried homeopathy instead.<ref>Phenix, p. 206</ref> By 1958, he was virtually paralyzed, and had difficulty sleeping. At the end of his life he was sleeping on the sofa in the living room of the couple's Cooksville house, to avoid waking his wife. He died there on the night of 11 August 1958.<ref>Phenix, p. 231</ref> His estate was valued at 12,123.47&nbsp;Canadian dollars,<ref>Phenix, p. 232</ref> about 93,000&nbsp;Canadian dollars as of 2010.<ref>[http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/rates/inflation_calc.html CPI inflation calculator], Bank of Canada, retrieved 23 September 2010</ref> The Grand Duchess died two years later, and was interred next to her husband in [[York Cemetery, Toronto]].<ref>Vorres, pp. 227–230</ref>
